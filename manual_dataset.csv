This is why Alberta has international trade offices and why the Premier and cabinet make foreign trips. The province also markets itself to investors: low-housing costs (at least when compared with Toronto and Vancouver), educated work force, political stability, high-quality amenities and gorgeous scenery. Therefore, it is surprising that Alberta announced a set of rules on Feb. 28 designed to drive out billions of dollars in potential investment in one globally-growing sector: renewable energy. In August, 2023, the UCP government announced a seven-month moratorium on renewable energy projects. This halted an estimated 118 projects at some stage of planning, worth a combined $33-billion, while the Alberta Utilities Commission (AUC) designed new rules. On Wednesday, those new rules were rolled out. They were designed to protect prime agriculture land from solar and wind farms, protect Alberta’s “pristine viewscapes,” provide funds for reclamation, and fund municipalities’ participation in AUC hearings (paid for by project proponents). On the surface, there is nothing wrong with these rules. However, dig deeper down and there are fundamental problems. First, these rules will make achieving future renewables projects very difficult. For example, the windiest part of the province is in the south. But the 35-kilometre buffer zone around protected areas means that about 75 per cent of Southern Alberta would be off limits to wind farms. Second, the new rules only apply to renewable energy, and not to oil and gas development, which dominates the province. For example, Alberta has over 170,000 orphaned and abandoned wells and it is estimated that it will cost at least $60-billion (and likely more) to properly clean them up. Strict regulations around wind and solar reclamation are fine, but should they not also apply to the much more serious problem of abandoned oil wells? Third, Alberta is telling private landowners what they can and cannot do with their property. Tellingly, landowners find it very difficult to prevent oil and gas development on their property (because they do not own the subsurface rights), but they could be blocked from allowing a solar or wind farm on their property. For a UCP government that often talks about the sanctity of property rights, removing them to harm a particular sector is instructive. Fourth, while the purpose of the rules is to preserve prime agricultural land, an analysis shows that if all the new solar farms needed to get Alberta to net-zero electricity by 2035 were on unirrigated crop land, their total footprint would only be 0.15 per cent. At the heart of Alberta’s new rules is the fact that the provincial government simply does not like renewable energy. Prior to the moratorium, Alberta, at over 75 per cent, was the top destination for renewable energy projects in Canada. However, the August, 2023, mortarium sent a strong signal to renewables companies that they should consider investing elsewhere. The new rules solidified that point. Why is renewables investment undesirable? Well, renewables are seen as competitors to oil and gas. In contrast, oil and gas companies support new technologies such as carbon capture and storage and small modular reactors (which have not had additional regulations attached to their development), because those are seen as complementary. There have been accusations for years that the Alberta government has been captured by the oil and gas sector. For instance, the Alberta Energy Regulator is widely seen as an organization that is not independent, but overtly supports the industry. In addition, current and former oil and gas executives and lobbyists are situated throughout the present government, including Premier Danielle Smith and other elected politicians, staffers, and advisers. Soon after becoming Premier in October, 2022, Danielle Smith even floated an idea that she first proposed as a lobbyist: giving multimillion-dollar royalty breaks to oil companies to clean up the wells that they were already legally responsible for. Ms. Smith has repeatedly proclaimed that Alberta is a “natural gas province.” And of course, the repeated political fights with Ottawa over oil pipelines, net-zero electricity regulations by 2035, or an emissions cap for the oil industry. These fights have included fierce rhetoric, legal challenges, and even the passing of the Sovereignty Act, which was designed to thwart federal laws and policies that the province believes are unconstitutional. The decision on renewables is just another important data point. The UCP government brands itself as a pro-business party that provides significant benefits to the Alberta economy. But by taking concrete steps to prevent billions of dollars in investment – because they do not like the type of investment, for spurious reasons – the UCP is showing itself to be a government that can be nothing else other than pro-oil and gas."
1,Real,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/oil-industry-justin-trudeau-alberta-danielle-smith-1.7122223,2/22/24,Oil,Some sectors of oil industry 'dragging their heels' on climate in favour of profit: Trudeau,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith found themselves at loggerheads yet again Wednesday after he suggested that at least some in the oilpatch have prioritized profits over securing a long-term future for its workers. In an interview on Real Talk Ryan Jespersen, Trudeau said that parts of the oil and gas industry, by ""dragging its heels"" on decarbonization, had in fact turned its back on oilsands workers. Those remarks caught Smith's attention, who fired back on social media, calling his comments ""absurd"" and accusing him of using Alberta as a punching bag to win votes. Trudeau made the comments to Jespersen when the prime minister was asked why many workers in the oil industry feel like the federal government doesn't have their backs. ""In some sectors, some of the oilsands companies have been really innovative and are leading the way on that. And that is great. And we are encouraging them, and we're investing with them. We're supporting them in decarbonization investments,"" Trudeau said. ""But those who are crossing their hands and saying, 'You know what, the world's still going to need oil for another decade so, another few decades or so. It's still going to need every drop that we can produce. ""'So why would we raise our costs right now and invest in innovation, when we can just do the same things we've been doing for decades and make profits — and the fact that we're going to leave people with a dirty mess and no jobs, because we haven't prepared for the jobs of the future?'"" When asked by CBC News as to specify which companies Trudeau was referring to in the interview, a spokesperson in the Prime Minister's Office said they had nothing to add beyond those comments. During his interview on Real Talk, the prime minister went on to say that the companies that are ""dragging their heels"" might suggest that such a problem is one for the next generation to handle, while the job of companies today is to draw profits. ""That is what is hurting oilsands workers. They've been fooled by people who are saying, 'Oh no, no. Climate change is a Liberal or a Chinese plot. You don't have to worry about it. Just keeping doing things exactly as they were a decade ago, two decades ago,'"" Trudeau said. ""That's not preparing for the future that Albertans, like all Canadians, know is changing."" In the interview, Trudeau also criticized provincial leadership for what he said was a hesitant approach toward climate change and stressed the importance of Alberta's role in leading Canada's transition to renewable energy and meeting climate targets. ""If you can build the technology necessary for an oilsands refinery, you can build the technology necessary for a hydrogen plant. These are things that Albertans will have great jobs in in the future, if the Alberta government gets out of its ideological opposition to doing things that are good for workers, good for the planet,"" Trudeau said. Trudeau was in Edmonton to announce $175 million in funding as part of the federal Housing Accelerator program, which is intended to be used to build 5,200 new housing units in the city over the next three years. Smith says PM's interview was 'absurd' Smith on Wednesday had a televised address in which she suggested Alberta would trim spending with an eye toward growing the Heritage Savings Trust Fund in an effort to wean the province off resource revenue by 2050. She was quick to respond to Trudeau's interview on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""We know that Albertans do not take his absurd claims seriously; however, it is sad to see this prime minister, like his father before him, try to use Alberta as a punching bag to win votes in other parts of the country,"" Smith wrote. ""Instead of attacking our province, Mr. Trudeau could have informed our government about his visit to Alberta and extended an invitation to meet with me to discuss our amazing energy sector and workers."" The premier also suggested Trudeau had called Albertans ""fools."" In the interview, Trudeau said Albertans were getting fooled by right-wing politicians. ""If the Alberta government … gets out of its ideological opposition to doing things that are good for workers, good for the planet, maybe not good for classic oilsands companies, except that they're also investing massively in decarbonization, and renewables, this is the dynamic that, quite frankly, Albertans are getting fooled by right-wing politicians,"" he said.In her post on X, Smith also said that ""next time the prime minister visits Alberta, I hope he calls my office to arrange a meeting as he did with the premiers of Ontario, British Columbia and Manitoba. I await his call."" A staffer in the Prime Minister's Office said Smith's office was given a heads-up that the prime minister would be in Alberta. When asked to follow up, a spokesperson in the premier's office said her comment stood. ""The Prime Minister's Office merely gave the premier's office a heads-up hours before their visit, providing no context for their visit, extending no invitation to their announcement, nor requesting a meeting,"" Sam Blackett wrote to CBC News. ""This approach is immature for conducting business, especially considering that Premier Danielle Smith had given several of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's cabinet ministers numerous days' notice that she was going to Ottawa and had requested meetings with them."" Oil and gas industry has seen profits soar The oil and gas industry has seen its profits soar post-pandemic — 2022 was the most profitable year in the history of the oilpatch, and oil and gas sector CEO compensation jumped double-digits. Alberta oil output has also hit a new record as producers ramped up for the completion of the Trans Mountain expansion project, which was bought by the federal government in 2018 when the project's future looked cloudy. That project, which has suffered massive cost overruns, is expected to add over half a million barrels per day of Canadian oil export capacity when it comes online. Companies are always going to prioritize profits and shareholders, said Keith Stewart of Greenpeace Canada. ""Anyone who claims otherwise is trying to fool you. And Albertans aren't fools.… They can see electric vehicles coming in, and the way that's going to reduce demand for what they're selling right now,"" Stewart said. ""They should be skating to where the puck is going, rather than getting left behind and replicating the experience of Newfoundland with the cod industry."" CBC News has requested comment from the Pathways Alliance, a consortium of Canada's biggest oilsands companies. Oilsands companies are currently working to develop a proposed $16.5-billion carbon-capture project. CBC News has also requested comment from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Richard Masson is an executive fellow at the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy and chair of the World Petroleum Council-Canada, which hosted the World Petroleum Congress in Calgary last summer. The theme of that international meeting was the energy transition and ""the path to net-zero."" Masson said the oil and gas industry is working hard to move forward with mitigating emissions, but faces challenges due to unclear regulations and lengthy approval processes. ""This is a really complex problem. It's going to take all of the efforts of the federal government, the provincial government, and the industry. And if we don't get it right in the near term, we're going to be left behind,"" Masson said. On Thursday, Rebecca Schulz, Alberta's minister of environment and protected areas, accused the federal government of dragging its feet on passing an investment tax credit for carbon capture and utilization and storage projects. ""We are implementing a plan to meet global energy demands that aspires to carbon-neutrality by 2050, and it's time for Ottawa to stop working against us and start working with us in the best interest of Albertans and all Canadians,"" she said in a statement. A spokesperson for Jonathan Wilkinson, the federal minister of natural resources and energy, wrote in a statement to CBC News that the federal government appreciates ""that Pathways Alliance, which represents Canada's largest oilsands companies, has committed to net-zero by 2050, in line with Canada and the vast majority of the international community."" ""Now it is time for them to move on the actions that are necessary to achieve those goals,"" the spokesperson wrote.  Political analyst Lori Williams of Calgary's Mount Royal University said that while the prime minister and Wilkinson have previously not appeared to be particularly willing to go toe-to-toe with Alberta premiers on some of these issues, that calculation may be changing. ""It might make some sense, politically, or just even understandable to respond to attacks that have been happening for an extended period of time. I'm not sure that this is the most effective way of dealing with some of the differences between the two levels of government,"" Williams said. At the same time, Williams said some of Smith's characterizations of Trudeau's comments were not accurate. ""She claimed he called Albertans fools, and that's not at all what he said. He was warning about being fooled or deceived by certain initiatives or claims,"" Williams said. An Alberta-Ottawa working group has been meeting since last September with a stated goal of finding consensus around emissions reduction and energy development."
2,Real,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/cat-lake-first-nation-first-mining-gold-1.7131255,03/04/24,Mining,"Demanding a proper say, Cat Lake First Nation's injunction pauses First Mining Gold's road work for project","Cat Lake First Nation has been granted an injunction pausing a gold-mining company's construction of a temporary winter road leading to an exploration camp for a proposed open-pit mine in northwestern Ontario. In documents filed in divisional court, the Ojibway First Nation says the 18-kilometre access road is on traditional land and it wasn't consulted before the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) issued road construction permits to First Mining Gold Corporation (FMGC). Cat Lake First Nation Chief Russell Wesley told CBC Thunder Bay his community had been working on an Anishinaabe-led environmental impact assessment of the Springpole Mine Project, with funding and participation from FMGC. But the Ontario government's approval of the permits ""caused conflict,"" he said. ""It looks like the First Nations are being combative when in fact we're not,"" Wesley said. ""If the province hadn't issued the permits, we would still be going through this process."" The northwestern Ontario community, home to about 650 people, is 440 kilometres northwest of Thunder Bay along the Albany River. Its band council declared a moratorium on mining exploration and related road construction in December 2022 and it was renewed this fall. Meanwhile, Cat Lake is contending with several other challenges, most recently the loss of its nursing station in a fire Saturday night. The building was the community's central access point to health-care services. Why the injunction was granted Cat Lake filed the injunction in court on Feb. 21. Two days later, Regional Senior Justice W.D. Newton issued an interim order for the mining company to pause road construction as the First Nation seeks a judicial review of the MNRF's decision to authorize the work. Newton is expected to hear the motion this week. In issuing the injunction, Newton cited the importance of consultation with Cat Lake First Nation and its concerns over possible ""irreparable harm"" from continued construction. Cat Lake's court efforts come amid escalating tensions between First Nations in the region and the Ontario government over a surge of mining claims, particularly in the Ring of Fire. The crescent-shaped, 5,000-square-kilometre area about 500 kilometres northeast of Thunder Bay is said to be rich in metals needed for electric vehicle (EV) batteries. But there are also concerns, including by many First Nations, that the provincial government's ambitions for the Ring of Fire could threaten their way of life. A spokesperson for the MNRF confirmed to CBC that permits were issued to FMGC on Feb. 9 ""for the construction of a temporary access corridor to the Springpole Project site."" Asked to respond to Cat Lake's concerns that the permits were issued without consultation, the spokesperson said in an email, ""As this matter is before the courts, we are not able to comment on anything further at this time."" Current winter road a danger, company CEO says FMGC calls its proposed Springpole Mine one of the largest gold projects in Canada. The company has been operating its exploration camp since 2015. A feasibility study for the project is underway and a draft environmental impact assessment was published in June 2022. Dan Wilton, FMGC's chief executive officer, said the warm winter has created a dangerous situation for workers using the existing winter road. ""This temporary winter road will allow First Mining to keep its focus on operating in a safe and environmentally responsible manner,"" Wilton said in a news release on Feb. 26. ""While it is disappointing that Cat Lake First Nation has chosen to oppose these important, temporary safety activities, First Mining continues to listen to the concerns of Indigenous communities and is always willing to meet with community leaders to discuss these and any other matters regarding our activities in their traditional territories."" A spokesperson for the company told CBC News they couldn't accommodate an interview by publication time. First Nation cites lack of capacity to respond The Springpole project requires both provincial and federal environmental assessments (EAs). The First Nation says its own Anishinaabe-led environmental impact assessment is the first of its kind in Ontario. Section 35 of Canada's Constitution outlines the Crown's duty to consult First Nations on land development projects. In practice, the onus falls on industry and First Nations rather than the government, said Wesley. He said Cat Lake lacks the capacity to deal with the government's EAs and the ""barrage"" of mining claims that have been sent to him for review since before the COVID-19 pandemic. ""When you have a system like that, it's very rigid. The timeline is rigid — there's really no deviation from that."" In November, Wesley unveiled a symbolic button at the Chiefs of Ontario conference that depicted Lynx cats watching Premier Doug Ford riding a bulldozer. The artwork, designed by Indigenous artist Deanna Therriault, represents the community's opposition to mining without consent. Wesley stressed, however, that Cat Lake's moratorium on mining was only put in place to give First Nation leadership time ""to consult our people properly."" He is calling for more flexibility within the government's environmental assessment processes and more support for First Nations, including ways to allow them to carry out Anishinaabe-led environmental impact assessments. ""Most First Nations like mine are not opposed to development … if we're allowed to participate and make informed decisions,"" he said. ""Right now the way things are, we do not have that system that allows us to do that."" Incorporating Indigenous law While the court injunction to pause the road's construction is a win, lecturer Daniel Cox said, Cat Lake could face other challenges as the case moves through the courts. Cox, who teaches at the Bora Laskin Faculty of Law in Thunder Bay, is a member of Fort William First Nation. He said one challenge the First Nation may encounter stems from a fundamental difference in how justice is approached. He said the provincial court system uses Aboriginal law (how Indigenous people interact with the Canadian legal system) to promote reconciliation. He said that differs from traditional Indigenous law (which represents traditional systems of governance and law practised for generations by First Nations). ""Trying to find space, I suppose, is the biggest difficulty for traditional Indigenous laws in this country versus Aboriginal law, which is very much a colonial system of law that these First Nations have to navigate,"" Cox said. Last summer, the federal government released the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act Action Plan. A key part of the declaration is First Nations' rights to free, prior and informed consent, which sets a higher standard than the Crown's duty to consult. ""The hope is perhaps that this declaration can be invoked to move the law towards a standard of free, prior and informed consent — so I think that would go a long way to increasing First Nations' involvement in these types of projects,"" said Cox. ""It's a work in progress. The jury is still out. It's a relatively new adoption of these principles, so we'll see."" He said it may be helpful for First Nations to co-ordinate legal strategies when it comes to cases around development — which is what the First Nations Land Defence Alliance has achieved. ""It'll be up to these First Nations to try to assert these rights and argue for this type of change. But unfortunately, it's still a question of navigating a court system, which is at its heart an adversarial system, and it takes time for cases to work their way through the courts."""
3,Real,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/guilbeault-no-new-roads-1.7114867,02/14/24,Climate,"Feds will stop investing in 'large' road projects, environment minister says","Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault said Monday the federal government will stop investing in new road infrastructure — a comment that immediately drew attacks from the Opposition Conservatives and some premiers who said the climate activist turned politician is out of touch. Guilbeault later clarified his remarks, telling reporters Wednesday that he meant to say Ottawa will not put up the cash for ""large"" road projects. ""Of course we're funding roads. We have programs to fund roads,"" he said. Guilbeault said Monday the federal government will be there to support provinces paying for maintenance but Ottawa has decided that existing road infrastructure ""is perfectly adequate to respond to the needs we have."" ""There will be no more envelopes from the federal government to enlarge the road network,"" Guilbeault said, according to quotes published in the Montreal Gazette. ""We can very well achieve our goals of economic, social and human development without more enlargement of the road network."" Guilbeault said the federal government is intent on moving people out of their cars and into public transportation, which the government has spent billions to build. He said the federal government also wants to encourage ""active transit,"" which means getting people to walk and cycle. The minister said federal money that's been spent on asphalt and concrete for roads in the past is ""better invested into projects that will help fight climate change and adapt to its impacts."" No funding for 'large projects' Pressed by reporters to defend his comments Wednesday, Guilbeault said he should have been ""more specific"" by stating that the federal government will not be funding ""large projects."" He cited Quebec City's long-proposed third link as one project that will not receive funding from Ottawa. ""What we have said, and maybe I should have been more specific, is that we don't have funds for large projects like the '3eme lien' that the CAQ has been trying to do for many years,"" he said of Quebec's provincial government. A senior government official told CBC News said ""there are no changes to federal policy."" In question period, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government will continue to invest in ""infrastructure."" Asked if he'd condemn Guilbeault's assertion that the federal government is getting out of the business of funding some road projects, Trudeau said the minister ""clarified"" his remarks earlier and the government's ""approach to infrastructure continues to be one of investing in the future for Canadians."" Trudeau defended the government's record on infrastructure, saying Ottawa has helped fund the Champlain bridge in Montreal, the planned Gordie Howe bridge in Windsor and the twinning of the Trans-Canada highway in Newfoundland, among other projects. The government has spent hefty sums on roads in the past. The ""gas tax fund,"" which was rebranded by the Liberals as the Canada Community-Building Fund, has routinely delivered billions of dollars to provinces and municipalities to support construction and maintenance of highways and local roads and bridges. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said Guilbeault's a ""radical"" who seems intent on banning federal funds from road projects. Conservative MP Mark Strahl, the party's transport critic, said Guilbeault's talk about no more new funding for ""large"" roads is ""outrageous"" and an affront to the people who rely on cars to get to and from work. ""This isn't something many Canadians do without. To simply say we're not going to allow any federal money to go into that is extreme, it's divisive and it's right in line with what this government does,"" Strahl said. ""But we should expect that from a guy who scaled the CN Tower, climbed on top of a premier's house and was led away in handcuffs. That's the kind of extremism that he's about,"" Strahl said, referring to Guilbeault's past activism, which led to arrests for stunts. Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, a frequent critic of Guilbeault, pounced on the remarks, saying in a social media post that the Montreal cabinet minister doesn't understand that many Canadians live in suburban, rural and remote areas where transit isn't as well-developed. ""Most of us can't just head out the door in the snow and rain and just walk 10 kilometres to work each day,"" Smith said. At an unrelated press conference about tourism in Alberta, Smith said Wednesday that Guilbeault is ""tone deaf."" ""He's losing credibility every single day. I don't know why his caucus and his cabinet is putting up with it — that's something they will have to deal with internally,"" she said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford is another premier who has had choice words for Guilbeault in the past — he's called Guilbeault ""a real piece of work"" and an ""extremist."" Ford said Wednesday he was ""gobsmacked"" by Guilbeault's latest policy pronouncement. ""A federal minister said they won't invest in new roads or highways,"" Ford said in a social media post. ""He doesn't care that you're stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic. I do. We're building roads and highways, with or without a cent from the feds."" Guilbeault's comments put into question the future of Ford's promised Highway 413 project, a new highway in the northwest part of the Greater Toronto Area that will connect two major arteries in the area and ease travel between booming areas like Vaughan and Brampton. Ontario has argued that the project should be fast-tracked because the population growth in these Toronto suburbs demands more infrastructure to ease congestion. Environmentalists and some local groups have vigorously opposed the 60-kilometre highway because it will cut through farmland and waterways and pave over parts of the province's protected greenbelt. Lengthy review In that context, the federal government decided in 2021 that the project should be subjected to Ottawa's impact assessment, which means it will go through a more stringent and lengthy environmental review. The Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, which carries out these reviews, reports to Guilbeault. Late last year, Ford said if Brampton Liberal MPs don't support the project, they risk losing their jobs in the next election because voters there want to see highways like this built. ""Just look at what happened when Highway 413 worked out for the Liberal and NDP candidates right here in Brampton — they all got swept because they didn't agree with 413,"" he said, referring to his party's victory in the 2022 provincial election. Mixed record in the courts Guilbeault has pursued an ambitious climate agenda since taking the job in 2021. He's a keen proponent of the plan to hike the federal carbon tax to discourage the use of fossil fuels like oil and gas and he's the lead minister on the push to green the country's electricity grid. Guilbeault's clean electricity draft regulations require that the country's grid be net-zero by 2035. That's a tall order for provinces like Alberta and Saskatchewan where coal and natural gas are key fuel sources for power generation. The premiers of those provinces have called the measure an act of jurisdictional overreach on Ottawa's part and have vowed to fight it. The government's climate agenda has a mixed record in the courts. The Supreme Court of Canada upheld the Liberal carbon pricing scheme. But in a 2023 reference case, the top court found the government's impact assessment bill — which gives Ottawa the authority to review projects like Highway 413 — was largely unconstitutional. The court said many provisions of Bill C-69 gave Ottawa powers that were too broad and not linked closely enough to what the Constitution calls federal business. A reference case is not legally binding, but the decision did force Ottawa to consider that ruling when crafting its cap on oil and gas emissions. As for the government's push to ban single-use plastics by deeming them ""toxic,"" the Federal Court ruled last year that the policy is ""unreasonable and unconstitutional."""
4,Real,Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/10292216/climate-change-health-risks-bc-report/,02/13/2024,Climate,"Floods and fires: Climate change brings health risks, finds B.C. report","Communities across British Columbia needs to prepare for a climate-related health crisis like the deadly 2021 heat dome every year, according to the lead contributor to a report on health risks associated with climate change. Dr. Michael Schwandt, a medical health officer with Vancouver Coastal Health, said the region needs to increase its resilience to extreme heat events, and risks “colossal harms” if it doesn’t. “I think that while events like the 2021 heat dome aren’t expected to happen in a given summer, we need to be prepared for something like that every single summer going forward,” he said on Tuesday, referring to the weather phenomenon that shattered temperature records and was linked to more than 600 deaths in B.C. “So that’s something that I would say our public health program spends a lot of time thinking about and working with partners to be more prepared for.” The report on protecting health in a climate emergency, released by Vancouver Coastal Health’s Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Patricia Daly, makes 17 recommendations about responding to health risks linked to extreme heat, wildfire smoke, flooding and droughts. The report recommends updating municipal and provincial building codes, bylaws and rental standards to require cooling features such as air conditioning in new buildings and enable modifications to existing homes. It says features such as shades, green spaces and heat pumps should be promoted, and also calls for improvements to indoor air quality to mitigate wildfire smoke. Schwandt said inaction on risks associated with climate change puts people at risk. “We have seen that the impacts of a changing climate in extreme heat in particular, can be massive, and can be very rapid. So we think that mitigating climate change and adapting to it does have the opportunity to protect lives,” he said. “And I think that the evidence that we have shows us that the failure to do that could lead to colossal harms.” A survey in Vancouver found temperatures of more than 31 degrees Celsius inside some homes in the summers of 2021, 2022 and 2023, the study said. Temperatures that high are considered dangerous, particularly for people who are already susceptible to high heat. “So we think that this really does show a concern that overall, our housing in our region is not really prepared for the changing climate that we’re seeing,” Schwandt said. Daly said every community within the Vancouver Coastal Health region, which covers 1.25 million people, is at risk of harm because of the changing climate but that the risks differ for each community, depending on its geography and demographics.  The report calls for more investment in protecting drinking water systems, with a focus on smaller systems that are more at risk. It points to examples such as rapid snow melt in Whistler, B.C., in 2021 that led to cloudiness in the water and a boil-water advisory for people with compromised immune systems. Extreme rainfall in the Sunshine Coast later that year led to landslides and another boil-water advisory. The report says communities should be provided with air quality monitors to offer real-time local data if they are not covered by existing government monitors. Daly’s report said there needs to be better support for older adults and people with disabilities during extreme heat events and more work needs to be done with Indigenous populations to understand the specific risks they face and increase their resilience. She said many of the recommendations are already being worked on by government and NGOs and she thinks they will be taken seriously. She said her office will be holding workshops with local governments and community groups to discuss her recommendations as well as meeting with provincial ministries. "
5,Real,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-timmins-canada-nickel-company-processing-plants-1.7108251,02/08/24,Climate,New mineral processing plants touted as 'missing link' for Ontario's EV industry,"A Canadian mining company will announce plans Thursday for two new processing facilities that its CEO says will provide the ""missing link"" in Ontario's plans for building a full-fledged electric vehicle industry.  Canada Nickel Co. intends to develop a nickel processing plant as well as a stainless-steel and alloy production facility in the region of Timmins, its officials told CBC News ahead of the announcement. EV batteries can contain 80 per cent or more nickel, making the metal a key component for the growing industry. ""We're going to see nickel demand double or triple over the next 10 years as we gear up battery production here in North America,"" said Mark Selby, chief executive of Canada Nickel, in an interview with CBC News. Premier Doug Ford's government is trying to position Ontario as a start-to-finish location for electric vehicle manufacturing, from mining the materials for EV batteries, forging the steel for the vehicle bodies, to final assembly. The provincial and federal government are combining to pour billions of dollars into production incentives for EV battery plants located in southern Ontario, which could be fed by minerals from northern Ontario. Selby says his company's mineral processing plants will be crucial to the EV supply chain in the province. ""The key piece that's missing is this first-stage conversion, after you take the products from the mine and then turn them into a usable product,"" he said. ""Being able to provide that processing capacity that provides that missing link is vitally important.""  Ontario's Minister of Mines George Pirie calls the plan a tremendous opportunity that takes advantage of the province's mineral resources. ""It speaks to what we believe in, in Ontario, securing the supply chain and doing it a fashion that's zero carbon footprint,"" Pirie said in an interview. Canada Nickel says all carbon emissions from both plants will be captured and stored in the tailings of its planned Crawford mine, north of Timmins. Ontario recently moved to allow underground carbon capture, a way of fighting climate change by trapping greenhouse gas emissions instead of releasing them into the atmosphere. Mining industry customers want products that are produced with as little carbon emissions as possible, says Selby. ""Being able to deliver a zero-carbon product both from the mine and then through the first stage of processing is a massive advantage,"" he said. In a news release, Canada Nickel says it is considering several possible locations near Timmins for the new plants and expects the nickel processing facility to begin production by 2027. The company says the nickel plant will grow to have the capacity to process more than 80,000 tonnes annually, which would make it the largest nickel processing facility in North America.

Canada’s Alberta province said last month that wildfire season had already begun, well before the typical March start. On the other side of the planet, South Australia instituted outdoor fire bans in mid-October, weeks ahead of when it normally does. Article content Article content While late-winter fires aren’t unusual in the Texas Panhandle, the current blaze is the worst in the state’s history. In the rest of Texas, where winter conflagrations are rare, the summer wildfire season is starting earlier and getting longer. Read More: How Extreme Weather Like Libya’s Flooding Is Linked to Climate Change Behind the many culprits of forest and brush fires — from land management to downed power lines — is the shadow of climate change. Global warming is contributing to hot, dry conditions at times of the year that historically were rainier. That’s complicating government efforts to prevent the blazes and intensifying pressure on electric utilities to shore up their systems. “Climate is connected to fire in many ways — most obviously through extreme weather conditions — but climate also influences ignitions, fuel, moisture and the growth of vegetation,” said Hamish Clarke, a senior research fellow at the University of Melbourne’s Flare Wildfire Research Group. “In many cases it’s going to make things much, much worse.” The fire scorching homes and ranches across the Texas Panhandle started after a dry spell that lasted a few weeks, allowing the grass to dry out. On Feb. 26, high winds swept through the area as temperatures soared. Nearby Amarillo posted a record high of 82F (28C) for the date. “Climate change certainly played a role in the amount of heat and dryness,” said John Nielsen-Gammon, Texas state climatologist and a professor at Texas A&M University. Across Texas, the weather will stay sunny, dry and breezy through the rest of the week, said Frank Pereira, a senior branch forecaster at the US Weather Prediction Center. While not enough to trigger a red flag fire warning, dry and windy conditions can make fire fighting more difficult. Later in the week, there is a chance of showers that may help with the Smokehouse Creek fire and other blazes in the Texas Panhandle. Across the Panhandle and the rest of the southern Great Plains, there are two fire seasons: One comes at the end of winter into early spring and the other during the summer months, said Todd Lindley, science and operations officer for the National Weather Service in Norman, Oklahoma. “We are seeing an increase in our summer fire season,” Lindley said. “Summers have been trending hotter in the last couple of decades and that has had a corresponding increase in summer fire activity, especially in Texas and Oklahoma.” Article content This year, El Niño is amplifying the impact of a hotter climate. The weather pattern, a warming of the equatorial Pacific Ocean, usually brings rainier conditions to Texas and the rest of the US South. But this year, unusually, some storms have tracked north through Colorado, leaving hot, arid air across the Southwest and supercharging winds, said Ryan Truchelut, president of commercial forecaster WeatherTiger LLC. To the north in Canada, El Niño has worried forecasters for months because the phenomenon leads to more storms crossing the US rather than further north, cutting off large swaths of western Canada from snow. At least 72% of the country was in drought this winter, according to the North American Drought Monitor. A year ago, Canada’s wildfire season began early and morphed into its worst ever, blanketing the US in smoke that turned the skies over New York City an apocalyptic orange. Some of those blazes never went out. As of January, a record number of  “zombie fires” remained burning in the ground and under snow, with about 100 fires in British Columbia, according to Premier David Eby. Article content “We’re literally standing up an army of firefighters in British Columbia,” Eby told reporters on Feb. 23, citing 1,000 applicants for the forest fire service, agreements to lease aircraft and helicopters and discussions with the military. “We’re just profoundly worried about the situation we face.” Brett L’Esperance is chief executive officer of Dauntless Air, a private fleet of single-engine air tankers that fly across North America dumping water on wildfires. His crews went to Canada last year, but also fought fires in Louisiana and North Carolina, places that haven’t needed air tankers before. Across the continent, “fire season is starting much earlier than it did before and it ends later,” he said. Thousands of miles away in Australia, El Niño tends to dry out large swaths of land, leading to more fires. Three years of wetter conditions accelerated vegetation growth before a record 2023 arid spell increased the flammability of that fuel — raising risks through a bushfire season that typically peaks in southern areas between December and February. Authorities in parts of Victoria state last month warned of the worst conditions since the so-called Black Summer fires of 2019 to 2020, which killed 33 people. Thousands of residents were evacuated last week near the regional city of Ballarat as blazes spread across at least 22,000 hectares (54,363 acres) of land and destroyed homes. Article content The fire threat is expected to linger through the southern hemisphere fall season, with heightened risks in parts of central and western Australia, according to AFAC, the national council for fire and emergency services. “Obviously there are so many different actions we can take to prepare for and to mitigate bushfire risk, but to me it’s a real no-brainer: Let’s not put more heat into the system,” the University of Melbourne’s Clarke said. “We need to be taking strong climate change action.”"

Lesley Kelly, a grain farmer in Watrous, was concerned about the upcoming crop season due to a lack of moisture in the soil. Watrous, a town in central Saskatchewan, received 31 centimetres of snow over the weekend, according to Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). Kelly said the snow reaches her chest on some parts of her farm. ""Just a few days ago behind me this was all brown,"" Kelly said. ""Now with the added moisture, the added snow, I am breathing a sigh of relief as we head into this new crop year."" Kelly said she's experienced extreme drought conditions during recent crop seasons. She is hopeful that the recent snowfall brought enough moisture ahead of spring seeding, which starts in about 60 days, and that there will be more precipitation in the coming months. She said that her stress level about the upcoming season, on a scale of one to 10, went from nine to four in a matter of 24 hours. Snow is going to stick around With cold weather expected this week, the snow isn't going to melt right away, according to ECCC meteorologist Eric Dykes. ""It's not like it's late April, early May. This snow is going to stay and then slowly melt and be absorbed by the ground,"" Dykes said. ""To what degree it's going to help with the drought issues, I can't speak to that, but I know it's going to help in some way, shape or form certainly."" Kris Cherewyk, an agrologist and farmer near Norquay in eastern Saskatchewan, liked what he saw out his window this past weekend and during another dump of snow in late February. ""I wouldn't say there was a dire situation like we've seen in some other parts of the province, but we were definitely wishing for the snow and we got it,"" Cherewyk said on CBC Radio's The Morning Edition. Cherewyk said the snow that fell is dry and more susceptible to blowing around. ""If it all goes all blows into the ditch, then that doesn't really help you very much in your field,"" Cherewyk said. ""So when you have that standing stubble, it'll catch the snow and then it'll go into the ground instead."" Hoping for rain Cherewyk said the snowfall is great, but he is still hopeful for more rain during the crop season. ""In our area here in Norquay, we didn't have rain from about the middle of June to close to the middle of July, and if we had just had even that extra inch, it would have gone from a good year to a great year,"" Cherewyk said. The Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation (SCIC) announced the details of its 2024 Crop Insurance Program on Tuesday. SCIC has issued more than $6 billion in insurance claims through its programs over the past three years. The majority of those claims have been weather related, according to a Government of Saskatchewan news release. It is estimated that the corporation paid out $1.85 billion in insurance claims for last year's season, according to SCIC president Jeff Morrow. Saskatchewan Agriculture Minister David Marit said it is too early in the year to anticipate whether there will be an increase or decrease in crop insurance claims, but that there is some optimism about the crop season because there is more moisture in the ground now than this time last year. ""We obviously need June and July moisture as well, so we'll look forward to that, but it's good to see the snow and obviously this will give us moisture to not only not only put the crop in the ground and start it, but also for the pastures as well fo the grass to get a start,"" Marit said. Marit said droughts remain a concern in the province and there are some areas of Saskatchewan that need to see more moisture, including the southwest."
8,Real,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/inaccurate-data-forest-fuels-may-stoke-bc-wildfires-study-1.7132509,03/03/24,Wildfire,Inaccurate government data may be stoking wildfires: UBC study,"Wildfire fighting and forest management decisions are potentially being hampered by inaccurate government data that misrepresents forest fuel loads in British Columbia's Interior, a new study has found. The B.C. government says the provincial wildfire service is working with the study's lead author and others to close the data gap, which involves ""mismatches"" between remotely-sensed mapping, forest fuel classifications and observations on the ground. ""These mismatches make it difficult for fire managers to accurately determine expected fire behaviour before an event occurs,"" the researchers say in the study published in the peer-reviewed journal Fire Ecology last month. The mismatches may also result in failure to identify at-risk areas that would benefit from work to mitigate the fuel buildup, the paper says. Understanding the mix of flame-stoking grasses, branches and dead trees in the forest is crucial to managing risk, because those fuels are the only factors that people can change in the short term to influence fire behaviour, it says. The researchers from the University of B.C. and Canadian Forest Service acknowledge that mapping forest fuels is ""notoriously challenging"" despite its importance in influencing and predicting wildfire behaviour. 'Poor correspondence' between observations, data Lead author Jen Baron says fixing the data will help officials identify and respond to fire-prone areas, though will likely require a ""huge lift."" ""The challenge is that we're trying to use these fuel-type maps to decide where to put fuel treatments,"" she says, referring to measures such as prescribed burning, thinning dense forests or burning piles of ""slash"" following logging. The study comes after Canada suffered its most-destructive fire season ever recorded, which burned more than 180,000 square kilometres by the end of September 2023, including more than 28,000 square kilometres of land in B.C., where hundreds of homes were destroyed in the Okanagan and Shuswap regions. Baron said improving how experts map various fuel types will help researchers and wildfire officials understand how fuels interact with today's environmental conditions, and with each other, to influence fire behaviour, Baron says. ""What we really need to be able to do is link the fuel conditions, the fire behaviour,"" Baron, a sessional lecturer at the department of forest and conservation sciences at the University of B.C., explained. ""Things like the rate of spread, the intensity, the flame length — and the weather, so we can understand how they all work together under different scenarios."" The paper found ""poor correspondence"" between field observations and government data, specifically B.C.'s vegetation resource index and the national fire behaviour prediction system. The researchers identified 76 plots in an area known as the Rocky Mountain Trench separating the Columbia and Rocky Mountain ranges in southeastern B.C. They found ""no suitable match"" between national system's data and field observations in 58 per cent of the one-hectare plots. A further 42 per cent were ""partially suitable,"" the paper says. The national and provincial forest inventory data are largely derived from aerial imaging, and Baron says it was ""significantly underestimating"" the density of underbrush that serves as a conduit for flames travelling up to the forest canopy. Problems with prediction system The study also revealed problems with Canada's fire behaviour prediction system when it comes to classifying fuel types in B.C.'s Interior, Baron says. The existing system uses data from a series of experimental burns 60 years ago, when fire weather and fuel beds were ""very different than they are today,"" she says. It was also designed primarily to inform fire suppression in boreal forests and uses 16 fuel types to represent conditions throughout Canada, Baron says. ""There just really aren't enough fuel types to represent the diversity of conditions that we have in Interior B.C."" One example of a mismatch could be an area with a fuel type listed as mature lodgepole pine forest, but if it had been logged, leaving a buildup of ""slash,"" Baron says the system may not capture the real fuel load and potential risk. The provincial wildfire service uses the existing fuel-type mapping, but officials are aware of its limitations and use their own expertise and observations to make decisions about fire suppression and fuel mitigation efforts, she adds. In an emailed statement, the Forests Ministry says the B.C. Wildfire Service is working with Baron and other researchers to improve fuel classification. This spring, Baron will look at how fire behaviour specialists are using the existing data in combination with local knowledge to ""calibrate their predictions,"" it says. The B.C. government is also working to improve its forest inventory data by acquiring LiDAR mapping for the whole province. Short for ""light detection and ranging,"" the aerial mapping process using laser-based technology. Still, Baron says researchers will also need data from the field, in finer detail than LiDAR can offer, as well as data on fire behaviour under different conditions. The ministry statement says the B.C. Wildfire Service has ""expanded the research element"" of prescribed burning, and fire behaviour observers will accompany front line teams to collect data from active blazes."
9,Real,Calgary Herald,https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/varcoe-danielle-smith-alberta-agriculture-land-renewables-pause,2/14/2024,Oil,"Varcoe: Smith says Alberta won't sterilize 'prime agriculture land,' as renewables pause ends this month","Alberta remained a powerful magnet for investment in Canada’s renewable sector last year, home to a whopping 92 per cent of the country’s growth in installed wind and solar capacity. It’s a figure the Canadian Renewable Energy Association, which tracks the data, calls “remarkable,” but it also arrives as a contentious pause has been placed on approving new wind and solar projects in Alberta — at least until the end of this month. Article content Article content Rules and policies overseeing future developments in Alberta are coming, even as competition from other provinces ramps up for such investment. “Alberta has been remarkable for multiple years in a row,” association CEO Vittoria Bellissimo said Tuesday, noting the province’s open electricity market has helped attract spending in recent years. “The 92 per cent speaks to what was built in 2023, but it doesn’t really speak to the diversification that is on the horizon across the country. And Albertans should look at that as competition.” According to the industry group, Alberta added two gigawatts (GW) of installed wind and solar capacity in 2023, while the entire country saw a total of 2.16 GW of new capacity. And in 2022, the province was also home to three-quarters of all new wind and solar generation capacity. Last year’s bonanza came even with Alberta’s mid-year pause on new project approval, which was put in place in August. Developments already under construction were not affected by the temporary moratorium. The UCP government is now examining policies to oversee the industry’s rapid growth, including its use of farmland and the potential for mandatory reclamation security requirements. In an interview last week, Premier Danielle Smith reiterated the pause will end on Feb. 29, and addressed the issue of using farmland for renewable energy facilities. “The industry should expect that as they’re building out and getting approvals for these installations, we are not going to be sterilizing prime agricultural land,” Smith said. “They will have to be looking at either agrivoltaics, or they’ll have to be looking at marginal lands. And there really are some innovative designs that allow for the panels to be far enough apart so that you can run a combine through them or graze cattle . . . We just don’t want to be sterilizing agriculture land.” According to the U.S. Department of Energy, agrivoltaics are solar photovoltaic systems built in such a way that allows for agricultural production — such as crops or livestock — on the land. There are 314 such projects identified in the United States. Alberta’s policy will also discuss how new developments can use existing transmission infrastructure, to reduce system costs, and requirements for site reclamation once a project reaches the end of its life, Smith noted. “We need to develop a plan to have the money set aside when they’re removed, but also have a plan to ensure that we’re able to recycle those panels, as well as the turbines, when they get removed,” the premier said. “People shouldn’t be surprised to see that there will be some requirement for having a plan to ensure the money is there when those come to the end of their natural life. “And also on transmission policy . . . you will see that we’re going to strongly incentivize co-location, so we can make better use of our existing infrastructure.” There is also an opportunity for microgeneration, and the province will try to create a framework that “incentivizes that kind of installation as well,” Smith added. Bellissimo noted that most agreements between private landowners and renewable project developers already include provisions for site reclamation plans. Sara Hastings-Simon of the University of Calgary’s School of Public Policy said Smith’s remarks have her questioning “what the need for — and the justification of — a pause was,” noting some issues are already being addressed by the sector. “In renewables, unlike oil and gas, landowners have a choice whether or not they want these projects on their land,” Hastings-Simon said. “Yes, we should have remediation plans and ensure the money is set aside, but I would like to see the provincial government apply this to all forms of energy development, not just one form.” Whatever happens, Alberta will need to ensure there’s investment certainty moving forward, say developers. Alberta’s strong wind and solar resources, along with the structure of the province’s deregulated power market, have helped attract billions of dollars in investment in recent years. The deregulated market allows developers to build new wind or solar facilities and sell the electricity, along with associated renewable energy credits, to corporate customers through power purchase agreements. Article content According to the Business Renewables Centre Canada, corporate-based PPAs have attracted more than $6.4 billion in investment — including $2.4 billion for projects announced last year — and enabled more than four gigawatts of renewable capacity from new projects since 2019. Other provinces such as B.C. and Quebec are moving forward with more renewable energy procurement programs, which will increase the competition for investment. Grant Arnold, CEO of BluEarth Renewables of Calgary, which has about 333 megawatts of wind and solar operating in Alberta — and another 400 megawatts of proposed projects — said the company hasn’t cancelled any developments due to the pause. But it has spent more time and money on the early stages of project development and engineering work in other jurisdictions. As for the provincial review, Arnold said he doesn’t want to see any “artificial barriers” adopted that penalize one form of power generation over another, and believes any new rules should be forward-looking and not affect existing projects. “I would really like to see a signal that they would like us to invest more in the province. It’s something we want to do but, again, we’re looking for investor certainty,” he added. “Alberta is sitting in a great spot from a resource perspective and (as a) place to invest, should the conditions return. So I’m really hoping that we can do that and keep some dollars in Alberta.”

10,Fake,Epoch Times,https://archive.is/aluG2,02/04/2024,Climate Change,UN Says Melting Arctic Ice is a Key Indicator of Climate Change—But It’s Not Melting,"It’s bad news for polar bears, according to the most recent assessment report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a United Nations organization. Because of increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gas emissions, modeling and simulations predict the Arctic will be without ice during the month of September by 2050. “We project an ice-free Arctic in September under all scenarios considered,” a scientific report highlighting IPCC’s findings states. “These results emphasize the profound impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on the Arctic.” A similar prediction was made in 2013, but at that time, the prediction was for no ice by about 2033. “All climate models are projecting an ice-free summer within the next 20 years or so,” Ron Kwok, a senior research scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory said in July 2013. “It’s not very far away.” However, a new report by Allan Astrup Jensen, the research director and CEO at the Nordic Institute of Product Sustainability and Environmental Chemistry and Toxicology in Denmark, shows that from September 2007 through September 2023, Arctic sea ice declines were near zero. “The facts are that the Arctic Sea ice extent measured by satellites since 1978 expresses annual variations, and it has declined considerably from 1997 to 2007. However, before that time period, from 1978 to 1996, the downward trend was minimal, and in the last 17 years, from 2007 to 2023, the downward trend has also been about zero,” the report states. “Therefore, there is no indication that we should expect the Arctic Sea summer ice to disappear completely, as predicted, in one or two decades.” Mr. Jensen told The Epoch Times that the IPCC and other organizations “exclude the possibility that the sea ice extent may expand in the future and even reach levels from before 1996. “That is because they believe that the driver of the sea ice extent is the predicted warming by rising CO2 levels in the troposphere.” Frank Geisel is an ocean engineer and naval architect, who examined ice thickness in the Arctic and Antarctic with the Coast Guard over several expeditions in the 1980s. He said it’s problematic to measure sea ice extent and ice thickness and then conclude that CO2 is driving a decline and should then be mitigated. “We can’t just issue a command and say, ‘If we do this, then this will happen,’” Mr. Geisel told The Epoch Times. “Well, maybe. But maybe not.” The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) uses NSIDC data to record Arctic sea ice yearly minimums in September, at the end of the summer melt season. The measurement is based on sea ice extent, which is the square mileage of ice covering the Arctic Ocean during a specified time. In September 1979, NOAA reported that the Arctic sea ice yearly minimum was 2.72 million square miles. At that same time, CO2 concentrations were 337.1 parts per million (ppm), according to The Nature Conservancy. Nearly 20 years later, in 1996, CO2 concentrations had risen to 362.58 ppm, and the September Arctic sea ice yearly minimum had increased to 2.93 million square miles. After 1996, the sea ice extent declined until 2007, with the most significant drop occurring between 2006 and 2007—from 2.26 million square miles in 2006 to 1.65 million square miles by 2007. CO2 concentrations were 383.37 ppm. After the 2007 results were released, the American Geophysical Union issued a report warning that the Arctic may be “on the verge” of a fundamental change, and images of starving polar bears stranded on floating ice slabs became commonplace. Due in part to their declining habitat, on May 15, 2008, polar bears were listed as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act. But the sea ice extent recordings in the Septembers of 2008 and 2009 increased, and despite hitting a record low in 2012, from 2007 to 2023, sea ice declines have been close to zero. In September 2023—during what NOAA’s Ms. Kapnick called “by far” the warmest year in NOAA’s 174-year climate record—the Arctic sea ice yearly minimum was 1.69 million square miles, an increase of about 40,000 square miles from 2007. CO2 was 421.55 ppm in 2023. Mr. Jensen said a couple of years ago he started to make and post charts and diagrams with NSDIC’s data to provide people with simple visual representations. “My first diagram I did send to NSIDC but I got no reaction from that organization. It surprised me. It has also surprised me that many people, including scientists and even friends, are difficult to convince that the sea ice has been unchanged since 2007, although I use the same official data also used by the IPCC,” Mr. Jensen said. “They are brainwashed by the many alarmist news articles telling about a decrease in the Arctic Sea ice, and [by] their great respect for the U.N. organization, IPCC.” Mr. Geisel said he’s concerned some scientists and policymakers are using “a very precise, almost microanalysis on a very, very macro situation.” “We’re looking at processes that change over decades, and we’re trying to understand how we’re going to respond this year,” Mr. Geisel said. “If you study the weather systems in the high Arctic, there’s a tremendous high-pressure system that’s well known by weather geeks, that sits on the top of the Pole… And it shifts, and it’s well known that it shifts positions and thus changes the weather patterns on a decadal frequency—we’re talking 10, 12 years. “Those are really massive, longer-term processes that all of our technology can’t fully understand.” Mr. Geisel made the comparison to scientists who closely study hurricanes via satellite imagery and who still aren’t able to fully understand how they'll behave in the near future. “We have all this imagery, and we can model [hurricanes] very carefully, and they can be modeled down to a scale of about 100 meters,” he said. “But the mitigation of it as it’s coming to shore isn’t done on a 100-meter basis. It’s done on a 100-mile basis. When a hurricane comes to the coast of Florida, the governor says, ‘Everybody out!’ So, the resolutions of these measurements don’t necessarily equate to mitigation or even an understanding of the consequences.” NSIDC takes satellite measurements of sea ice and records where ice concentrations are at least 15 percent to understand sea ice extent. NOAA then uses the September measurements to plot sea ice extent over time. But the margin of error is significant. “During summer melt and freeze-up in the fall, the extent may be underestimated by 1 million square miles; during mid and late winter before melt starts, the error will be on the low end of the estimates,” NSIDC states. The sea ice area data can be off by up to a million square miles when measured in September, according to NSDIC, compared to March, which has a smaller margin of error. When plotted on a graph, the decrease in sea ice extent from 1979 to 2023 using March’s more accurate number shows half the rate of decline at 15,000 square miles compared to September’s rate of decline at 30,000 square miles. Climate models are only as good as the data put into them, Mr. Jensen said. “The sharp decrease in Arctic Sea ice extent before 2007, when the Nobel Prize was delivered to IPCC and Al Gore, was supposed to continue forever. In that light, the predictions were fair,” he said. However, when it became clear that the decrease had stopped, they should have stopped such predictions,” he said. “That was, however, difficult politically for them because that would put the whole issue of climate change by CO2 in doubt since the Arctic Sea ice decline had been a major argument for the CO2 theory.” Additionally, satellite imagery of sea ice extent didn’t start in 1979, despite most graphs using that as their starting point. Using imagery from its old satellites, NASA has pieced together rough estimates of sea ice extent as far back as the 1960s. Mr. Jensen pointed out that though the satellite images from the 1960s were not as accurate as today’s models, they still give an overall picture that doesn’t align with NOAA’s consistently declining sea ice extent claims. “The extent was possibly lower in some years before 1978. Thus, 1978–1996 levels were possibly a maximum period. Such a max could show up again in the future if CO2 is not the driver of Arctic Sea ice extent,” Mr. Jensen said. In an archived report from the early 1990s, IPCC states, “Since about 1976 the areal extent of sea-ice in the Northern Hemisphere has varied about a constant climatological level but in 1972–1975 sea-ice extent was significantly less. “In the Southern Hemisphere since about 1981, sea-ice extent has also varied about a constant level. Between 1973 and 1980 there were periods of several years when Southern Hemisphere sea-ice extent was either appreciably more than or less than that typical in the 1980s.” Mr. Jensen said “it seems clear” that changes in Antarctic Sea ice are driven mainly by El Nino and La Nina. “Maybe the Gulf Steam from the Atlantic and other Pacific Ocean currents are the Arctic’s main sea ice driver? More research is needed,”  he said. When asked to comment on Mr. Jensen’s report, NSIDC’s senior research scientist Walt Meier said it was “nothing new and contains no significant scientific findings.” “2007 was a record low minimum. Using 2007 as the starting point is cherry-picking a start year to minimize the trend and does not provide a scientifically useful metric of change. The overall trend since the start of our consistent and continuous satellite data started in 1979 shows a strong downward trend over 45 years,” Mr. Meier told The Epoch Times via email. “The 17 years from 2007 to 2023 are the 17 lowest years in the record. Analysis of ice type and ice thickness shows a substantial decline in thickness with a near complete disappearance of the oldest and thickest ice in the Arctic. The Arctic sea ice environment is fundamentally changed from the 1970s and 1980s.” Mr. Meier said NSICD only includes data from satellite images from 1979, “because it is the highest quality long-term record. Adding earlier data can provide further context, but doesn’t change the conclusions using the data starting in 1979.” When asked why we haven’t seen a downward sea ice extent trend commensurate with increasing CO2 ppm—if CO2 is the primary driver of sea ice decline—Mr. Meier said, “Greenhouse gas emissions affect sea ice, and climate in general, as a long-term ‘thumb on the scale.’ “There is always variability in the climate, so we expect ups and downs. Global temperatures do not rise steadily each year—other factors, such as El Nino or La Nina—play a role as well. But greenhouse gasses add a little extra ‘fuel’ each year.” Meanwhile, in the third highest monthly gain in 45 years, Arctic sea ice increased by 4.63 million square miles in December 2023, according to NSIDC’s latest report. The sea ice extent increased by an average of 33,700 square miles per day, “markedly faster than the 1981 to 2010 average of 24,700 square miles per day,” the report stated."

Unfortunately, breathing less isn't one of them.

Methane and nitrous oxide in the air we exhale makes up to 0.1 per cent of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions, scientists say. 
And that's not even accounting for the gas we release from burps and farts, or emissions that come from our skin without us noticing.The new study was led by Dr Nicholas Cowan, an atmospheric physicist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Edinburgh. 
'Exhaled human breath can contain small, elevated concentrations of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), both of which contribute to global warming,' Dr Cowan and colleagues say. 
'We would urge caution in the assumption that emissions from humans are negligible.'
As most of us remember from science classes at school, humans breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. 
When we inhale, air enters the lungs, and oxygen from that air moves to the blood, while carbon dioxide (CO2), a waste gas, moves from the blood to the lungs and is breathed out. 
With plants, it is the other way round; plants use CO2 to create oxygen as a by-product (the process known as photosynthesis). Every person breathes out CO2 when they exhale, but in their new study, the researchers focused on methane and nitrous oxide.
These two are both powerful greenhouse gases, but because they're breathed out in much smaller quantities, their contribution to global warming may have been overlooked. What's more, plants essentially soak up all the CO2 that's emitted in human breath, so 'CO2 contribution in human breath to climate change is essentially zero,' Dr Cowan told MailOnline. 
The same cannot be said for methane and nitrous oxide, as plants don't use these gases in photosynthesis. 
For the study, the researchers investigated emissions of methane and nitrous oxide in human breath from 104 adult volunteers from the UK population.
Participants were required to take in a deep breath and hold it for five seconds, then exhale into a sealable plastic bag.
A total of 328 breath samples were collected and every participant had details recorded such as age, sex and dietary preference. After analysing the samples, researchers found nitrous oxide was emitted by every participant, but methane was found in the breath of only 31 per cent of participants.
Researchers say those who do not exhale methane in their breath are still likely to 'release the gas in flatus' – in other words, by farting. 
Interestingly, people with methane in their exhaled breath were more likely to be female and above the age of 30, but researchers aren't sure why. 
Concentrations of the two gases in the overall samples let the researchers estimate the proportion of the UK's emissions are from our breath – 0.05 per cent for methane and 0.1 per cent for nitrous oxide.
Dr Cowan stresses that each of these percentages relate specifically to these respective gases, not all of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions as a whole. 
Researchers didn't manage to find any link between gases in the breath and diets – although meat eaters are known to fuel the climate crisis in other ways. 
The experts stress that their study only looked at greenhouse gases in breath, and so it does not provide an overall estimate of a person's emissions footprint. According to the authors, emissions of methane and nitrous oxide are 'generally ignored in most environmental monitoring' as they're considered negligible. 
However, further study of human emissions of these gases - not just from our breath - could reveal more about 'the impacts of an ageing population and shifting diets,' the team say.
Inside the human body, methane gas is produced by microorganisms called methanogens, which colonise our digestive tract.
The methane crosses into the blood and is carried to the lungs where it can be exhaled in breath.
Meanwhile, bacteria in the gut and oral cavity turns nitrates in food and water to nitrous oxide, which also escapes in human breath. 
The study has been published in the journal. "
12,Fake,WSJ,https://archive.is/uFBw4,11/03/2023,Global Warming,"The Earth Is Warming, but Is CO2 the Cause?","If this column has ever plagiarized itself, it’s by repeating the phrase “evidence of warming is not evidence of what causes warming.” A paper published by the Norwegian government’s statistical agency, written by two of its retired experts, touching on this very subject has called forth so many shrieked accusations of climate apostasy that you know it must be interesting.
The authors ask a simple question: Are computerized climate simulations a sufficient basis for attributing observed warming to human CO2? After all, the Earth’s climate has been subject to substantial warming and cooling trends for millennia that remain unexplained and can’t be attributed to fossil fuels. As statisticians, their conclusion: “With the current level of knowledge, it seems impossible to determine how much of the temperature increase is due to emissions of CO2.”
Wow. For all the abuse dumped on them for this modest observation, and even some apologetic hemming and hawing from the government-run Statistics Norway, the authors don’t say climate models don’t make useful predictions. Their predictions are useful precisely for testing the validity of climate models. What’s more, many who are concerned about climate change have no trouble seeing the problem as a matter of risks rather than certainties. This includes co-author John Dagsvik, who told Norway’s Aftenposten newspaper he favors emissions curbs for precautionary reasons.
The correlation-to-causation puzzle is hardly the authors’ invention, having bedeviled the oracular Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change since its founding in 1988. But unrestrained name-calling is required, the critics say, because anything that undermines confidence in climate models undermines progress against climate change. Which is laughable. What progress? If any proposition has been demonstrated beyond doubt, equating skepticism with Holocaust denial etc. is the most failed salesmanship strategy in the history of public policy, as readily shown in the emissions data.
What really upsets the critics, though they are petrified to say so, is the paper’s ever so gently brushing its sleeve against the measurement problem.
Since we’re using abstruse calculations of an annual average global temperature to validate the climate models, it matters if these calculations—based on disparate instruments and unstable sampling frequencies and a variety of “proxies” for times and places when no measurements were taken—are accurate and meaningful.Before 2015, as I’ve previously noted, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that 2005 and 2010 were equally warm to the second decimal. By 2015, the record was changed to claim 2010 was warmer than 2005. Such adjustments are common and the Norwegians point out the obvious: “It is impossible to evaluate the validity of such administrative changes for an outside user of these records.” In 2017, independent researcher Marcia Wyatt showed 16 such revisions had been made to the long-past temperature record in just the previous three years.
I’ve long argued that if a future climate scandal is lurking, it’s here. A spirit of disingenuousness already pervades NOAA’s use of these numbers to make “hottest year” and “hottest month” proclamations, ignoring its own stated margin of error, which is often a large multiple of the claimed temperature difference from one period to the next.
Something beyond hysteria, though, explains the continued reliance on the no-longer-plausible idea that ritually attacking every expression of skepticism moves the ball on climate policy. By now, it’s some people’s job, if not personal vocation, to enact these rituals of denunciation simply because it helps prop up the green corporate welfare that has become the primary substitute for climate action as well as the primary incentive for anyone to spend working hours participating in these now-tired activities.
The same week brought forth a new study from one of the most venerable of climate warriors, former NASA scientist James Hansen, whose own brand of discordance throws the climate crowd into a tizzy of cognitive dissonance. Warming will be worse, his paper predicts, for an ironic reason: Our success in reducing particulate exhaust from vehicles and power sources has reduced the atmospheric aerosols that slow warming. Mr. Hansen champions nuclear power, which remains anathema to many greens, and research into using aerosols artificially to cool the planet, even more anathema, since it doesn’t involve a giant convulsion of green socialism. You can bet most of his argument will be ignored except the part about faster warming, since it can be used to bludgeon any deniers who might be handy.
As long as we’re noting ironies, much of the abuse of the Norwegian authors comes from their fellow Norwegians, whose pretense of green virtue is funded by their country being, per capita, one of the biggest exporters of oil and gas the world has ever known."
13,Fake,Epoch Times,https://archive.ph/mWpxh,08/29/2023,Climate Change,"Over 1,600 Scientists Sign ‘No Climate Emergency’ Declaration","International scientists have jointly signed a declaration dismissing the existence of a climate crisis and insisting that carbon dioxide is beneficial to Earth, contrary to the popular alarmist narrative. “There is no climate emergency,” the Global Climate Intelligence Group (CLINTEL) said in its World Climate Declaration (pdf), made public in August. “Climate science should be less political, while climate policies should be more scientific. Scientists should openly address uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming, while politicians should dispassionately count the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of their policy measures.” A total of 1,609 scientists and professionals from around the world have signed the declaration, including 321 from the United States. The coalition pointed out that Earth’s climate has varied as long as it has existed, with the planet experiencing several cold and warm phases. The Little Ice Age only ended as recently as 1850, they said. ""Therefore, it is no surprise that we now are experiencing a period of warming,"" the declaration said. Warming is happening “far slower” than predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “Climate models have many shortcomings and are not remotely plausible as policy tools,” the coalition said, adding that these models ""exaggerate the effect of greenhouse gases"" and ""ignore the fact that enriching the atmosphere with CO2 is beneficial.” For instance, even though climate alarmists characterize CO2 as environmentally-damaging, the coalition pointed out that the gas is “not a pollutant.” Carbon dioxide is “essential” to all life on earth and is “favorable” for nature. Extra CO2 results in the growth of global plant biomass while also boosting the yields of crops worldwide. CLINTEL also dismissed the narrative of global warming being linked to increased natural disasters like hurricanes, floods, and droughts, stressing that there is “no statistical evidence” to support these claims. “There is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no cause for panic and alarm. We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic net-zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050. Go for adaptation instead of mitigation; adaptation works whatever the causes are,” it said. “To believe the outcome of a climate model is to believe what the model makers have put in. This is precisely the problem of today’s climate discussion to which climate models are central. Climate science has degenerated into a discussion based on beliefs, not on sound self-critical science. Should not we free ourselves from the naive belief in immature climate models?” Among the CLINTEL signatories are two Nobel laureates—physicists John Francis Clauser from the United States and Ivan Giaever, a Norwegian-American. Mr. Clauser has made a significant addition to climate models to dismiss the narrative of global warming: the visible light reflected by cumulus clouds which, on average, cover half of the earth. Current climate models vastly underestimate this aspect of cumulus cloud reflection, which plays a key role in regulating the earth’s temperature. Mr. Clauser previously told President Joe Biden that he disagreed with his climate policies. In May, Mr. Clauser was elected to the board of directors at the CO2 Coalition, a group focusing on the beneficial contributions of carbon dioxide in the environment. “The popular narrative about climate change reflects a dangerous corruption of science that threatens the world’s economy and the well-being of billions of people,” Mr. Clauser said in a May 5 statement. “Misguided climate science has metastasized into massive shock-journalistic pseudoscience. In turn, the pseudoscience has become a scapegoat for a wide variety of other unrelated ills.” “It has been promoted and extended by similarly misguided business marketing agents, politicians, journalists, government agencies, and environmentalists. In my opinion, there is no real climate crisis.” CLINTEL’s declaration against the climate change narrative counters propaganda spread by climate alarmists who have long predicted doomsday scenarios triggered by global warming—none of which have ever come true. In 1970, some climate scientists predicted that the earth would move into a new ice age by the 21st century. Pollution expert James Lodge predicted that “air pollution may obliterate the sun and cause a new ice age in the first third of the new century,” according to The Boston Globe. In May 1982, Mostafa Tolba, then-executive director of the United Nations environmental program, said that if the world did not change course, it would face an “environmental catastrophe which will witness devastation as complete, as irreversible, as any nuclear holocaust” by 2000. In June 2008, James Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute of Space Sciences, said that within five to 10 years, the Arctic would have no ice left in the summer. As climate alarmists continue to spread propaganda about global warming, the topic has become an issue in the 2024 presidential race, with multiple candidates openly dismissing it. In a July 13 post on X, Democrat presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that climate change “is being used to control us through fear.” “Freedom and free markets are a much better way to stop pollution. Polluters make themselves rich by making the public pay for the damage they do,"" he said. During the first 2024 GOP presidential debate, candidate Vivek Ramaswamy called climate change a “hoax.” “The reality is, the anti-carbon agenda is the wet blanket on our economy. And so the reality is, more people are dying of bad climate change policies than they are of actual climate change,” he said. High Temperatures, Biden’s Appliance Crackdown Climate activists have insisted that global warming is responsible for the soaring temperatures across the United States, even claiming that temperatures are hitting record highs. In a recent interview with The Epoch Times, John Christy, a climatologist and professor of atmospheric science at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, dismissed the narrative of record high temperatures. “Regionally, the West has seen its largest number of hot summer records in the past 100 years, but the Ohio Valley and Upper Midwest are experiencing their fewest,” he said. “For the conterminous U.S. as a whole, the last 10 years have produced only an average number of records. The 1930s are still champs.” Climate change policies have been used to justify sweeping lifestyle changes across the United States by the Energy Department, like restricting home appliances, and sometimes, even outright banning them. In June, the Energy Department proposed rules that would require ceiling fans to become more energy efficient, a development that could lead to manufacturers having to shell out $86.6 million per year in “increased equipment costs.” In February, the DOE proposed energy efficiency rules targeting gas stoves that would affect half of all new models of such stoves sold in the United States while making most of the existing ones noncompliant. In July, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission proposed a policy that would remove nearly all existing portable gas generators from the market. The Biden administration has already implemented a ban on incandescent light bulbs, which came into effect on Aug. 1."
14,Fake,Epoch Times,https://archive.ph/yRzbP,09/06/2022,Climate Change,"EXCLUSIVE: Former Greenpeace Founder Patrick Moore Says Climate Change Based on False Narratives
","Patrick Moore, one of the founders of Greenpeace said in an email obtained by The Epoch Times that his reasons for leaving Greenpeace were very clear: “Greenpeace was ‘hijacked’ by the political left when they realized there was money and power in the environmental movement. [Left-leaning] political activists in North America and Europe changed Greenpeace from a science-based organization to a political fundraising organization,” Moore said. Moore left Greenpeace in 1986, 15 years after he co-founded the organization. “The ‘environmental’ movement has become more of a political movement than an environmental movement,” he said. “They are primarily focused on creating narratives, stories, that are designed to instill fear and guilt into the public so the public will send them money.” He said they mainly operate behind closed doors with other political operatives at the U.N., World Economic Forum, and so on, all of which are primarily political in nature. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] is “not a science organization,” he said. “It is a political organization composed of the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Program. “The IPCC hires scientists to provide them with ‘information’ that supports the ‘climate emergency’ narrative. Their campaigns against fossil fuels, nuclear energy, CO2, plastic, etc., are misguided and designed to make people think the world will come to an end unless we cripple our civilization and destroy our economy. They are now a negative influence on the future of both the environment and human civilization.” “Today the left has adopted many policies that would be very destructive to civilization as they are not technically achievable.

He said “green” for the environment and “peace” for the people were the organization’s founding principles, but peace was largely forgotten, and green had become the sole agenda. “Many [so-called] ‘environmental’ leaders were now saying that ‘humans are the enemies of the Earth, the enemies of Nature.’ I could not accept that humans are the only evil species. This is too much like ‘original sin,’ that humans are born with evil, but all the other species are good, even cockroaches, mosquitos, and diseases,” Moore argued. He said the new dominant philosophy is that the world would be better if fewer people existed. “But the people who said this were not volunteering to be the first to go away. They behave as if they are superior to others. This kind of ‘pride’ and ‘conceit’ is the worst of the Cardinal Sins,” Moore said. Environmental Activist As a prominent scholar, ecologist, and long-time leader in the international environmental field, Patrick Moore is widely regarded as one of the world’s most qualified experts on the environment. He is also a founder of Greenpeace, the world’s largest environmental activist organization. Moore received his Ph.D. in Ecology from the University of British Columbia in 1974 and an Honorary Doctorate of Science from North Carolina State University in 2005. He co-founded Greenpeace in 1971 and served as president of Greenpeace Canada for nine years. From 1979 to 1986, Moore served as the Director of Greenpeace International, a driving force shaping the group’s policies and directions. During his 15-year tenure, Greenpeace became the world’s largest environmental activist organization. In 1991, Moore founded Greenspirit, a consultancy focusing on environmental policies, energy, climate change, biodiversity, genetically modified food, forests, fisheries, food, and resources. Between 2006 and 2012, Moore served as co-chairman of the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition, a U.S.-based environmental advocacy group. In 2014, he was appointed Chairman of Ecology, Energy, and Prosperity of Frontier Centre for Public Policy, a non-partisan Canadian public policy think tank. In 2019 and 2020, Moore served as the Chair of CO2 Coalition, a U.S.-based nonprofit environmental advocacy group dedicated to disputing false claims on CO2 as relates to climate change. False Narrative on Chlorine “At the time I decided to leave Greenpeace, I was one of 6 Directors of Greenpeace International. I was the only one with formal science education, BSc Honors in Science and Forestry, and Ph.D. in Ecology. My fellow directors decided that Greenpeace should begin a campaign to ‘Ban Chlorine Worldwide.’” Moore said it is true that elemental chlorine gas is highly toxic and was used as a weapon in World War I. However, chlorine is one of the 94 [naturally-ocurring] elements on the Periodic Table and has many roles in biology and human health. For example, table salt (NaCl or Sodium Chloride) is an essential nutrient for all animals and many plants. It is impossible to “ban” NaCl He pointed out that adding chlorine to drinking water, swimming pools, and spas was one of the most significant advances in public health history in preventing the spread of water-borne communicable diseases such as cholera. And about 85 percent of pharmaceutical drugs are made with chlorine-related chemistry, and about 25 percent of all our medicines contain chlorine. All halogens, including chlorine, bromine, and iodine, are powerful antibiotics; without them, medicine would not be the same. “Greenpeace named chlorine ‘The Devil’s Element’ and calls PVC, polyvinyl chloride, or simply vinyl, ‘the Poison Plastic.’ All of this is fake [and] to scare the public. In addition, this misguided policy reinforces the attitude that humans are not a worthy species and that the world would be better off without them. I could not convince my fellow Greenpeace directors to abandon this misguided policy. This was the turning point for me,” Moore said. False Narrative on Polar Bears When asked how Greenpeace utilizes its massive donations, Moore said it was used to pay for “a very large staff” (likely over 2,000), extensive advertisements, and fundraising programs. And virtually all of the organization’s ads for fundraising are based on false narratives, which he had thoroughly disproven in his books, one example being the polar bears. “The International Treaty on Polar Bears, signed by all polar countries in 1973, to ban unrestricted hunting of polar bears, is never mentioned in the media, Greenpeace, or politicians who say the polar bear is going extinct due to melting ice in the Arctic. In fact, the polar bear population has increased from 6,000 to 8,000 in 1973 to 30,000 to 50,000 today. This is not disputed,” Moore said. “But now they say the polar bear will go extinct in 2100 as if they have a magic crystal ball that can predict the future. In fact, this past winter in the Arctic saw an expansion of ice from previous years, and Antarctica was colder during the last winter than in the past 50 years.” Moore said that he does not pretend to know everything and predict the future with confidence like many in the “climate emergency” business claim they can do. The Goal of the ‘Environmental Apocalypse’ Theory “I believe the human population has always been vulnerable to people who predict doom with false stories,” Moore said. “The Aztecs threw virgins into volcanos, and the Europeans and Americans burned women as witches for 200 years claiming this would ‘save the world’ from evil people. This has been [referred to as] ‘herd mentality,’ ‘groupthink,’ and ‘cult behavior.’ Humans are social animals with a hierarchy, and it is easiest to gain a high position by using fear and control.” Moore said the environmental apocalypse theory is mostly about “political power and control,” adding that he is dedicated to showing people that the situation is not as negative as they are told. “Today, in the richest countries, our descendants are making decisions that our grandchildren will have to pay for,” he said. “Predictions that the world is coming to an end have been made for thousands of years. Not once has this come true. Why should we believe it now?” “People are naturally afraid of the future because it is unknown and full of risks and difficult decisions. I believe there is also an element of ‘self-loathing’ in this apocalypse movement.” Moore said the young generation today are taught that humans are not worthy and are destroying the earth. This indoctrination has made them feel guilty and ashamed of themselves, which is the wrong way to go about life. The Demonization of Carbon Dioxide “Very few people believe the world is not warming. The record is clear that the world has been warming since about the year 1700, 150 years before we were using fossil fuels. 1700 was the peak of the Little Ice Age, which was very cold and caused crop failures and starvation. Before that, around 1000 A.D. was the Medieval Warm period when Vikings farmed Greenland. [And] before that, around 500 A.D. were the Dark Ages, and before that, the Roman Warm Period when it was warmer than today, and the sea level was 1–2 meters higher than today,” Moore said. “Even until about 1950, the amount of fossil fuel used and CO2 emitted were very small compared to today. We do not know the cause of these periodic fluctuations in temperature, but it was certainly not CO2.” Moore clarified that the “minority opinion” is not about the history of the Earth’s temperature, but it is the relationship between the temperature and CO2 that is at the center of the dispute. “In this regard, I agree that many believe CO2 is the main cause of warming. CO2 is invisible, so no one can actually see what it is doing. And this ‘majority’ are mainly scientists paid by politicians and bureaucrats, media making headlines, or activists making money. [The rest are] the public who believe this story even though they can’t actually see what CO2 is doing,” Moore said. Moore provided a graph of temperature continuously measured over 350 years (from 1659 to 2009) in central England. “If carbon dioxide was the main cause of warming, then there should be a rise in temperature along the carbon dioxide curve, but it doesn’t,” he explained. 1659–2009 Temperature and Carbon Dioxide Emissions in Central England. (Courtesy of Patrick Moore) Moore described the demonization of CO2 as “completely ridiculous.” He added that CO2 is the basis of all life on Earth and its concentration in the atmosphere today, even with the increase, is lower than it has been for a large majority of life’s existence. Rising CO2 Correlates With Increased Plantation: Study A study in 2013 found that increased levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) have helped boost green foliage across the world’s arid regions over the past 30 years. The Australian government agency CSIRO conducted the research in collaboration with Australian National University (ANU). The data was based on satellite observations from the year 1982 to 2010 across parts of the arid areas in Australia, North America, the Middle East, and Africa. It found an 11 percent increase in foliage cover in the studied area due to what’s called “CO2 fertilization.” The study said a fertilization effect occurs when elevated CO2 levels enable a leaf during photosynthesis—the process by which green plants convert sunlight into sugar—to extract more carbon from the air or lose less water to the air or both. “If elevated CO2 causes the water use of individual leaves to drop, plants in arid environments will respond by increasing their total numbers of leaves. These changes in leaf cover can be detected by satellite, particularly in deserts and savannas where the cover is less complete than in wet locations,” according to Randall Donohue, the CSIRO research scientist. Breaking the Global Warming Narrative “Climate alarmists prefer to discuss climate knowledge only since 1850. The time before this they referred to as the pre-industrial age. This ‘pre-industrial age’ was more than 3 billion years when life was on the Earth. Many climate changes [occurred during that period], including Ice Ages, Hothouse Ages, major extinctions due to asteroid impacts, and other unknown causes,” Moore said. “Today, the Earth is in the Pleistocene Ice Age, which began 2.6 million years ago. … So, the most recent major glaciation, which peaked 20,000 years ago, was not the end of the Ice Age. We are still in the Pleistocene Ice Age no matter how the climate alarmists wish to deny this.” He said the great irony of the present panic about the climate is that the Earth is colder today than it was for 250 million years before the Pleistocene Ice Age set in. And CO2 is lower now than in more than 95 percent of Earth’s history. “But you would never know this if you listen to all the people who benefit from the lie that the Earth will soon be too hot for life and that CO2 will become higher than in Earth’s history,” Moore said. ‘More CO2 Is Beneficial to the Environment and Humans’ According to Moore, nearly all commercial greenhouse farmers worldwide buy CO2 to inject into their greenhouses to realize up to 60 percent higher crop yields. “I was impressed when flying over South Korea [and seeing] how many greenhouses there are in the valleys. Like British Columbia, Korea has a lot of mountains and not so much flat fertile farmland. “I am sure the greenhouse farmers are putting more CO2 in their greenhouses, up to double and triple what it is in the atmosphere today. This is because nearly all plants growing outside in the natural atmosphere are starved for CO2, and it is what limits them from growing faster,” Moore added. “Please refer to the chapter titled ‘Climate of Fear and Guilt’ in my book, [Fake Invisible Catastrophes and Threats of Doom], if you wish to gain a full understanding of these facts,” he said. Moore said that most environmental activists, politicians, and so-called experts know that we cannot stop increasing the use of fossil fuels or reducing CO2 emissions within their proposed schedule. “In 2015, while attending the COP (Conference of the Parties) in Paris, I offered a public bet for $100,000 in a broadcast media release which went out on more than 200 media feeds, that by 2025 global CO2 emissions would be higher than in 2015. I did not receive one taker, not even from the ‘greens,’” Moore said. “I know that more CO2 is entirely beneficial to both the environment and human civilization. I am proud to be a director of the CO2 Coalition.” The Irony of ‘Carbon Neutrality’ Moore said “carbon neutrality” is a political term, not a scientific one. “It is simply wrong to call CO2 ‘carbon.’ Carbon is an element that is what diamonds, graphite, and carbon black (soot) are composed of. [And] CO2 is a molecule that contains carbon and oxygen and is an invisible gas that is the primary food for all life. [Likewise], it is incorrect to refer to NaCl (table salt) as ‘chlorine,’ even though NaCl contains chlorine,” Moore said. “He said when elements (atoms) combine with each other to form compounds (molecules), they always have very different properties than the elements they are made from. “‘Net-Zero’ is also a political term made-up by activists who are not scientists. For example, the top leaders of this crusade are people like Al Gore, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Greta Thunberg, none of whom are scientists.” According to Moore, Russia, China, and India are 40 percent of the human population, and they do not agree with this anti-fossil fuel agenda. “If we add Brazil, Indonesia, and most African countries, it is a majority of the population who are not climate fanatics,” Moore added. “Another great irony is that many countries with the coldest climates, such as Canada, Sweden, Germany, and the UK, are the most concerned about warming. For example, the average annual temperature in Canada is -5.35 degrees Celsius.” Moore also said that fumes from engines are not CO2; they are other substances, as CO2 is invisible and odorless. Dust is also not CO2; it is soot and can be controlled with present technology. And coal plants built today are much cleaner than ones built 20 years ago. ‘Wind and Solar Power Are Parasites on the Economy’ “Solar and wind power are both very expensive and very unreliable. It is almost like a mental illness that so many people have been brainwashed to think entire countries can be supported with these technologies,” Moore said. “I believe wind and solar energy are parasites on the larger economy. In other words, they make the country poorer than if other more reliable and less costly technologies were used.” Moore said that wind and solar providers rely heavily on government subsidies, tax write-offs, and mandates, where citizens are forced to buy wind and solar power even if it is more expensive, on the pretext that it is “environmentally friendly.” “Millions of people pay more for wind and solar energy while a few people make millions of dollars, marks, pounds, etc. It is a bit like a Ponzi scheme in the stock markets,” Moore added. “They require vast areas of land, are not available most of the time, and require reliable energy such as nuclear, hydroelectric, [coal, and natural] gas to be available when wind and solar are unavailable.” According to Moore, the construction of wind and solar farms uses vast amounts of fossil fuels for mining, transportation, and construction. And in many locations, they don’t produce nearly enough energy in their lifetimes as is required to build and maintain them. “Why not use reliable energy [such as nuclear, hydroelectricity, natural gas, etc.] as the primary source?” Moore questioned, adding if that were the case, “then wind and solar would be unnecessary.” ‘Plastic Is Not a Toxic Substance’ “Plastic is not a toxic substance. That is why we package and wrap our food in it, to prevent it from becoming contaminated. Plastic does not magically become toxic when it enters the ocean,” Moore said. “Of course, they say on one hand that plastic will never break down, and then, on the other hand, they say it will quickly decay into “microplastics,” which, of course, are conveniently invisible so no one can observe or verify this for themselves. How clever!” According to Moore, our digestive system can tell the difference between “food” and plastic or tiny particles of sand. Our body does not ingest sand into our bloodstream, no matter how microscopic the sand is. He said plastic floating in the ocean is like a tiny floating reef, the same as driftwood. It provides a surface for marine species to lay their eggs on, attach themselves to, and eat things that are attached to it. “Pollution is usually toxic or causes harm to life. Plastic is simply ‘litter’ beside the road. It is not hurting anything. One exception is discarded fishing nets, not because they are plastic but because they are shaped to catch fish. The environmental community should work with the fishing industry to stop throwing damaged nets in the sea and bring them back to the dock, where they can be recycled, used in a waste-to-energy plant, or discarded safely,” Moore added."
15,Fake,The Guardian,https://archive.is/b2yY7,03/20/2021,Solar Radiation,‘Our biggest challenge? Lack of imagination’: the scientists turning the desert green,"Flying into Egypt in early February to make the most important presentation of his life, Ties van der Hoeven prepared by listening to the podcast 13 Minutes To The Moon – the story of how Nasa accomplished the lunar landings. The mission he was discussing with the Egyptian government was more earthbound in nature, but every bit as ambitious. It could even represent a giant leap for mankind. Van der Hoeven is a co-founder of the Weather Makers, a Dutch firm of “holistic engineers” with a plan to regreen the Sinai peninsula – the small triangle of land that connects Egypt to Asia. Within a couple of decades, the Weather Makers believe, the Sinai could be transformed from a hot, dry, barren desert into a green haven teeming with life: forests, wetlands, farming land, wild flora and fauna. A regreened Sinai would alter local weather patterns and even change the direction of the winds, bringing more rain, the Weather Makers believe – hence their name. “If anybody doubts that the Sinai can be regreened,” Van der Hoeven told the Egyptian delegates, an assortment of academics, representatives of ministers and military top brass, “then you have to understand that landing on the moon was once thought unrealistic. They didn’t lay out a full, detailed roadmap when they started, but they had the vision. And step by step they made it happen.” Van der Hoeven is nothing if not persuasive. Voluble, energetic and down-to-earth, the 40-year-old engineer’s train of thought runs through disciplines from morphology to esoteric mysticism, often threatening to jump the tracks. But he is keenly focused on the future. “This world is ready for regenerative change,” he says. “It’s going to be a complete change of our behaviour as a species in the longer term. It is going to be a step as big as fire was for humanity.” It sounds impossibly far-fetched, but not only is the Weather Makers’ plan perfectly feasible, they insist, it is precisely the type of project humanity should be getting its head around right now. In recent years, discussion about the climate crisis has predominantly focused on fossil fuels and greenhouse gases; now, we’re coming to realise that the other side of that coin is protecting and replenishing the natural world. There is no better mechanism for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than nature, but in the past 5,000 years, human activity has reduced the Earth’s total biomass by an estimated 50%, and destroyed or degraded 70% of the world’s forests. As UN secretary general António Guterres put it last year: “Human activities are at the root of our descent toward chaos. But that means human action can help to solve it.” The Weather Makers know this very well: their origins are in dredging, one of the heaviest industries there is. Over the past few centuries, dredging has helped humans alter the face of the planet on ever-greater scales. Trained as a morphological engineer, Van der Hoeven has spent the past decade in the industry, working on projects across the world, including the artificial islands of Dubai, whose creation involved large-scale dredging and land reclamation. He got sucked into the expat lifestyle there, he admits: drinking, eating, partying, “I lost a little bit of my soul.” Returning to the Netherlands in 2008, he began to reexamine his own profession: “What I could see is that the dredging industry had so much potential; we were just misusing it.” Working for the Belgian company Deme, he devised a new method of dredging that was both more eco-friendly and more efficient. He used inexpensive sensors to model maritime conditions in real time – waves, currents, tides – so as to determine more precisely where and when it was safe to work. Trialling the system, he won over sceptical colleagues by living on the vessel with them, even cooking meals. Head office was also convinced when his technique saved a small fortune. In January 2016, Van der Hoeven was contacted by Deme’s Egyptian representative, Malik Boukebbous, who had been asked by the Egyptian government to look into restoring Lake Bardawil, a lagoon on the north coast of the Sinai. The lake was once 20 to 40 metres deep, but today is just a few metres deep. Dredging the lake and cutting channels to allow more water in from the Mediterranean would make it deeper, cooler and less salty – all of which would boost fish stocks. But Van der Hoeven did not want to stop there. “If I feel I’m on the right track, it’s difficult for people to distract me,” he says. He began looking at the Sinai peninsula in more detail: its history, weather patterns, geology, tides, plant and animal life, even religious texts. He took himself off other projects and spent long hours in his apartment surrounded by charts, maps, books, sketched diagrams. “People were afraid for me because I was forgetting myself. My friends were cooking for me.” The deeper he looked, the more potential he saw. There is evidence that the Sinai once was green – as recently as 4,500 to 8,000 years ago. Cave paintings found there depict trees and plants. Records in the 1,500-year-old Saint Catherine’s monastery, near Mount Sinai, tally harvests of wood. Satellite images reveal a network of rivers flowing from the mountains in the south towards the Mediterranean. What turned the Sinai into a desert was, most likely, human activity. Wherever they settle, humans tend to chop down trees and clear land. This loss of vegetation affects the land’s ability to retain moisture. Grazing animals trample and consume plants when they try to grow back. The soil loses its structure and is washed away – hence the silt in Lake Bardawil. Van der Hoeven calculated the lake contained about 2.5bn cubic metres of silt. If one were to restore the Sinai, this vast reserve of nutrient-rich material was exactly what would be needed. “It became clear we had a massive opportunity,” he says. “It wasn’t the solution to a single problem; it was the solution to all the problems.” By this stage, Van der Hoeven and Deme agreed that he would be best off working as a separate entity, so in 2017 he founded the Weather Makers with two friends: Gijs Bosman and Maddie Akkermans. Both appear to be steadying influences. Bosman, a project manager at Dutch engineering firm Royal HaskoningDHV and a friend since student days, had the ability to translate Van der Hoeven’s grand vision into actionable technical detail. Akkermans has a background in finance and economics. “Ties said, ‘I’m too chaotic. So I can’t do this alone,’” she says. “Having someone like me who could tell him the truth and keep him on track gave him the confidence to start a company.” They consulted with experts across disciplines, in particular a handful of veterans who have been ploughing the eco-restoration furrow for decades. Van der Hoeven calls them his “Jedi”. The first of these is John D Liu, a Chinese-American ecologist with a background in broadcasting. Restoring a landscape as large and as degraded as the Sinai sounds like science fiction, but it has been done before. While Van der Hoeven was immersed in his research, a friend implored him to watch a documentary called Green Gold, which Liu had made for Dutch television in 2012. It chronicles the story of the Loess plateau, an area of northern China almost the size of France. In 1994, Liu, who was working as a television journalist in Beijing, was asked by the World Bank to film the start of an ambitious restoration project, led by a pioneering Chinese scientist, Li Rui. At that time, the Loess plateau was much like the Sinai: a dry, barren, heavily eroded landscape. The soil was washing away and silting up the Yellow river. Farmers could barely grow any crops. The plan to restore it was huge in scale but relatively low tech: planting trees on the hilltops; terracing the steep slopes (by hand); adding organic material to the soil; controlling grazing animals; retaining water. The transformation has been astonishing. Within 20 years, the deserts of the Loess plateau became green valleys and productive farmland, as Green Gold documents. “I watched it 35 times in a row,” says Van der Hoeven. “Seeing that, I thought, ‘Let’s go for it!’” The Loess plateau project was also a turning point for Liu, he says – away from broadcasting and towards ecosystem restoration: “You start to see that everything is connected. It’s almost like you’re in the Matrix.” Despite his Jedi status, 68-year-old Liu is easygoing and conversational, more midwestern ex-hippy than cryptic Zen master. Since 2009, he has been an ambassador for Commonland, a Dutch nonprofit, and an adviser to Ecosystem Restoration Camps – a global network of hands-on, volunteer communities. After watching Green Gold, the Weather Makers practically burst into Commonland’s Amsterdam headquarters to share their plans. “They were not going to be denied!” Liu recalls. “I said, ‘We have to work with these people, because this is the most audacious thesis I’ve ever seen.’” Liu brought Van der Hoeven to China to see the Loess plateau first-hand. “To be in a place that had been essentially a desert where now it’s raining cats and dogs, and it’s not flooding, because it’s being infiltrated and retained in the system – it was all just so impressive to him.” Through Liu, Van der Hoeven met another Jedi: Prof Millán Millán, a Spanish meteorologist. In the 1990s, Millán began investigating the disappearance of summer storms in eastern Spain for the European commission. “What I found is that the loss is directly linked to the building up of coastal areas,” he says. Rainfall in the region comes almost entirely from Mediterranean sea breezes. However, the breeze alone doesn’t carry enough water vapour to create a storm inland; it needs to pick up extra moisture, which it used to do from the marshes and wetlands along the coast. Over the past two centuries, however, these wetlands have been built on or converted to farming land. No additional moisture; no more storms. “Once you take too much vegetation out, it leads to desertification very quickly,” says Millán. Such changes do not just affect the weather at a local level, Millán discovered: “The water vapour that doesn’t precipitate over the mountains goes back to the Mediterranean and accumulates in layers for about four or five days, and then it goes somewhere else: central Europe.” In other words, building on the Spanish coast was creating floods in Germany. Millán’s findings have gone largely unheeded by the European commission, he says. Now 79 and retired, he speaks with the gentle weariness of a long-ignored expert: “My criticism to them was: the old township barber would pull your teeth with pliers. It hurt, but it was effective. You’re still using those procedures, but you could save all your teeth.” Millán’s research and Liu’s experience in the Loess plateau arrived at essentially the same conclusion. Chop down the trees, destroy the ecosystem, and the rains disappear; restore the ecosystem, make a wetter landscape, and the rains come back. Millán distilled his work down to a simple maxim: “Water begets water, soil is the womb, vegetation is the midwife.” Regreening the Sinai is to some extent a question of restarting that “water begets water” feedback loop. After restoring Lake Bardawil, the second phase is to expand and restore the wetlands around it so as to evaporate more moisture and increase biodiversity. The Sinai coast is already a major global crossing point for migratory birds; restored wetlands would encourage more birds, which would add fertility and new plant species. When it comes to restoring inland areas of the Sinai, there is another challenge: fresh water. This is where another Jedi came into play: John Todd, a mild-mannered marine biologist and a pioneer in ecological design. In the 1970s, frustrated by the narrowness of academia, Todd established the New Alchemy Institute, an alternative research community in Massachusetts dedicated to sustainable living. One of his innovations was the “eco machine” – a low-tech installation consisting of clear-sided water barrels covered by a greenhouse. “An eco machine is basically a living technology,” Todd explains. The principle is that water flows from one barrel to the next, and each barrel contains a mini ecosystem: algae, plants, bacteria, fungi, worms, insects, fish; like a series of manmade ponds. As the water flows, it becomes cleaner and cleaner. “You could design one that would treat toxic waste or sewage, or you could design one to grow food. They are solar-driven, and have within them a very large amount of biodiversity – in a sense, they reflect the aggregate experience of life on Earth over the last 3.5bn years.” In the Sinai, eco machines would be used to grow plants and to produce fresh water. Last autumn, the Weather Makers built their own eco machine on a pig farm on the outskirts of the Dutch city of s’-Hertogenbosch, where they are based. For the first step in a plan to change the world, it is not exactly prepossessing. It looks like a standard agricultural polytunnel. On a cold, drizzly day, Weather Maker Pieter van Hout gives me a virtual tour. Inside the greenhouse are six clear-sided barrels filled with water of various shades of green and brown. In some of the tanks is leaf litter and dead plant material. Van Hout points out the brown algae growing on the sides: phytoplankton, the basis of the food web, which feeds life further up the chain: insects, snails and, in one tank, fish (in the Sinai these would be edible tilapia). Some water evaporates from the barrels and condenses on the inside skin of the greenhouse, where it is collected by a system of gutters. Even on a cold day in the Netherlands, there is a constant trickle into a container on the ground. In the heat of the Sinai, the cycle would run much faster, says Van Hout. The water feeding the eco machine would be salt water, but the water that condenses inside would be fresh water, which can then be used to irrigate plants. If the structure is designed correctly, one would only need to drum on the outside to create an artificial “rain” inside. When the plants and the soil inside the greenhouse reach a certain maturity, they become self-sustaining. The greenhouse can then be removed and the process repeated in a different spot. “The idea is that you may have 100 of these structures,” says John Todd. “And they’re spending five years in one site and then they’re moved, so these little ecologies are left behind.” In the Sinai, the sediment from Lake Bardawil would be pumped up to the hills, 50km inland, where it would then trickle back down through a network of eco machines. The saltiness of the sediment is actually an asset, says Van Hout, in that it has preserved all the nutrients. Flushing them through the eco machines will “reactivate” them. Around the water tanks, they are now testing to see which salt-tolerant plant species, or halophytes, grow best. Van Hout proudly points out a stack of white plastic tubs containing silt freshly scooped from the bottom of Lake Bardawil. “This is what ecosystem restoration looks like in real life,” he laughs, “buckets of very expensive mud.” Estimates of how much difference a regreened Sinai could make are hard to quantify. In terms of carbon sequestration, it would doubtless be “billions of tons”, says Van der Hoeven. But such metrics are not always helpful: if you convert atmospheric carbon into, say, phytoplankton, what happens when a fish eats that phytoplankton? Or when a bigger fish eats that fish? Another useful measure could be global temperature. In addition to sequestering carbon, green areas also help cool the planet. Deserts are heat producers, reflecting around 60% to 70% of the solar energy that falls on them straight back into the atmosphere. In areas covered by vegetation, much of that solar energy is instead used in evapotranspiration: the process of condensation and evaporation by which water moves between plants and the atmosphere. “If vegetation comes back, you increase cover, you reduce temperature, you reduce solar reflection, you start creating a stable climate,” says Van der Hoeven. “If we want to do something about global warming, we have to do something about deserts.” At present, the hot Sinai acts as a “vacuum cleaner”, drawing moist air from the Mediterranean and funnelling it towards the Indian Ocean. A cooler Sinai would mean less of that moisture being “lost”. Instead, it would fall as rain across the Middle East and north Africa, thus boosting the entire region’s natural potential. Van der Hoeven describes the Sinai peninsula as an “acupuncture point”: “There are certain points in this world where, if we accumulate our joint energy, we can make a big difference.” The Sinai is also an acupuncture point geopolitically, however. Post-Arab spring, the region has become a battle zone between Egyptian security forces and Islamist insurgents. There have been numerous terrorist incidents: the bombing of a Russian airliner in 2015 killed 224 people; an attack on a Sufi mosque in 2017 killed more than 300 worshippers. Northern Sinai is currently a no-go area to outsiders, controlled by the military, and plagued by poverty, terrorism and human rights abuses. Since 2018 the military has restricted access to Lake Bardawil for local fishermen to just a few months a year, says Ahmed Salem, founder of the UK-based Sinai Foundation for Human Rights. “There’s a lot of suffering,” he says, “because they don’t have any other way to earn money and feed their families.” A restored landscape would bring tangible benefits to locals, says Salem, but it all depends on the president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. “If Sisi really wants to help them [the Weather Makers], it will be OK for them because he’s like a god in Egypt. But if he doesn’t, they will fail.” But the Sisi government seems to have recognised that ecosystem regeneration could fix many problems at once: food security, poverty, political stability, climate goals, as well as the potential for a green project of international renown. The government is close to signing contracts for the first phase of the restoration plan, which covers the dredging of Lake Bardawil. Subsequent phases may well require financial support from external bodies such as the EU. As outsiders, the Weather Makers are aware their plan will require local support, cooperation and labour. Because of the military restrictions, none of them has visited Lake Bardawil, although they have forged links with an organic farm in southern Sinai named Habiba. Habiba was established in 1994, by Maged El Said, a charismatic, Cairo-born tour operator who fell in love with the region. Originally it was a beach resort, but in 2007 El Said branched into organic farming, and Habiba now connects other farms, local Bedouin tribes and academic institutions. El Said has some reservations about the Weather Makers’ plan: “It’s a big shiny project, but also you’re drastically changing the environment, the flora and fauna. I don’t know if there will be side-effects.” But in terms of the larger mission, they are very much aligned: “We are all in the same boat. Desertification and climate change is happening so fast, so we need action on the ground. Enough of workshops, enough seminars, talks, talks, talks.” On a global level, the tide is turning in the Weather Makers’ direction. Discussions about regreening, reforestation and rewilding have been growing in volume and urgency, boosted by high-profile advocates such as Greta Thunberg, David Attenborough and British ecologist Thomas Crowther, who made headlines in 2019 with research suggesting the climate crisis could be solved by planting 1tn trees (he later acknowledged it was not quite that simple). This year marks the beginning of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, “a rallying call for the protection and revival of ecosystems around the world”. The UN hopes to restore 350m hectares of land by 2030, which could remove an additional 13 to 26 gigatons of carbon from the atmosphere. After decades of compartmentalising environmental issues and missing its own targets, the UN, too, has come to realise that the only viable solution is to do it all at once. It particularly wants to rally younger people to the cause; its social media campaigns carry a “generation restoration” hashtag. “Ecosystem restoration is not a technical challenge; it’s a social challenge,” says Tim Christophersen, head of the Nature for Climate branch at the UN Environment Programme. Nations and corporations are also making ever more ambitious commitments to regreening, even if they are struggling to live up to them. The UK, for example, plans to create 30,000 hectares of woodland a year by 2025. India has pledged to restore 26m hectares of degraded land by 2030. Africa’s Great Green Wall, “the world’s largest ecosystem restoration project”, aims to plant an 8,000km line of trees across the Sahara Desert, from Senegal to Djibouti (14 years on, it is only around 15% complete). Meanwhile, green companies are taking root, such as Ecosia, the Berlin-based search engine, which to date has planted more than 120m trees around the world. “The main challenge,” Christophersen says, “is the lack of human imagination; our inability to see a different future because we’re staring down this dystopian path of pandemic, climate change, biodiversity loss. But the collective awareness that we are in this together is a huge opportunity. People don’t have a problem imagining what a four-lane highway would look like. But to imagine a restored landscape of over a million hectares – nobody knows what that would look like because it hasn’t really been done before.” Van der Hoeven would agree. He cites Yuval Noah Hariri’s book Sapiens, which argues that humans prevailed because of our ability to share information, ideas, stories: “We were able to believe in a myth – in something which was not there yet.” Regreening the Sinai is presently little more than a myth, just as the Apollo missions once were; but it now exists in the imagination, as a signpost for the future we aspire to. The more it is shared, the more likely it is to happen. It could come to be a turning point – an acupuncture point: “We’re not going to change humanity by saying, ‘Everything has to be less,’” says Van der Hoeven. “No, we have to do more of the good things. Why don’t we come together and do something in a positive way?”"
16,Fake,The Sun,https://archive.is/ArD82,05/13/2020,Solar Radiation,"SUN DOWN The sun has gone into ‘lockdown’ which could cause freezing weather, earthquakes and famine, say scientists","OUR sun has gone into lockdown, which could cause freezing weather, earthquakes and famine, scientists say. The sun is currently in a period of “solar minimum”, meaning activity on its surface has fallen dramatically. Experts believe we are about to enter the deepest period of sunshine “recession” ever recorded as sunspots have virtually disappeared. Astronomer Dr Tony Phillips said: “Solar Minimum is under way, and it’s a deep one. “Sunspot counts suggest it is one of the deepest of the past century. The sun’s magnetic field has become weak, allowing extra cosmic rays into the solar system. “Excess cosmic rays pose a health hazard to astronauts and polar air travellers, affect the electro-chemistry of Earth’s upper atmosphere, and may help trigger lightning.” Nasa scientists fear it could be a repeat of the Dalton Minimum, which happened between 1790 and 1830 — leading to periods of brutal cold, crop loss, famine and powerful volcanic eruptions. Temperatures plummeted by up to 2C over 20 years, devastating the world’s food production. On April 10, 1815, the second largest volcanic eruption in 2,000 years happened at Mount Tambora in Indonesia, killing at least 71,000 people. It also led to the so-called Year Without a Summer in 1816 — also nicknamed “eighteen hundred and froze to death” — when there was snow in July. So far this year the sun has been “blank” with no sunspots 76 per cent of the time, a rate surpassed only once before in the Space Age — last year, when it was 77 per cent blank."
17,Fake,Express,https://archive.is/MWRgn,2/18/2020,Global Warming,Global warming slowing down? 'Ironic' study finds more CO2 has slightly cooled the planet,"GLOBAL WARMING has been ""ironically"" set back by more carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, NASA scientists have astonishingly claimed. The process, known as evapotranspiration, occurs when plants consume the heat-trapping greenhouse gas and release water. The process, known as evapotranspiration, occurs when plants consume the heat-trapping greenhouse gas and release water. Much like humans sweating on a hot day, evapotranspiration can have a cooling effect on the air. In other words, with more carbon dioxide feeding plant growth, the planet is slightly cooler than otherwise expected. The effect was described in a paper published in the journal Nature Reviews Earth & Environment. Study co-author Jarle Bjerke of the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research said: “It is ironic that the very same carbon emissions responsible for harmful changes to climate are also fertilising plant growth which in turn is somewhat moderating global warming.” With more CO2 present in the atmosphere, NASA satellites have observed an increased greening of the planet. Data collected between 2000 and 2018 shows boreal and Arctic regions have become increasingly green as a result of global warming. According to NASA scientist Rama Nemani, areas such as Svalbard in the high-Arctic have seen up to a 30 percent increase in greenness. The greening was found to be concurrent with mean summer temperatures rising from 2.9C to 4.7C (37.2F to 40.5F) between 1986 and 2015. The scientists have now established the planet is greener than it has been in the early 1980s. ""Reducing carbon emissions is still needed in order to sustain the habitability of our planet"" Shilong Piao, Peking University. Forecast up until the year 2100 show the planet will likely become even greener. The data was collected by NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites. Other factors, such as nature conservation and reforestation, have also contributed to the change in greenness. In particular, satellite data shows China and India have grown much greener in the past years. Rising levels of CO2 have helped plant life thrive by increasing the rate of photosynthesis. According to the study, however, global warming has had a negative impact on greening in the tropics. Lead author Shilong Piao of Peking University said: “This greening and associated cooling is beneficial. “But reducing carbon emissions is still needed in order to sustain the habitability of our planet.” In their study, the scientists also noted increase greening and heat-trapping can have an inverse effect on land surface temperatures. Despite a slight cooling of the air, greener canopies absorb more sunlight than bare ground and lead to a process known as albedo warming. Overall, however, the scientists have proposed greening could be used to fight against the effects of global warming. In their study, they wrote: “Modelling indicates that greening could mitigate global warming by increasing the carbon sink on land and altering biogeophysical processes, mainly evaporative cooling. “Coupling high temporal and fine spatial resolution remote-sensing observations with ground measurements, increasing sampling in the tropics and Arctic, and modelling Earth systems in more detail will further our insights into the greening of Earth.”"
18,Fake,The Sun,https://archive.is/uUzZO,02/02/2020,Ice Age,"CHILL IN THE AIR Earth about to enter 30-YEAR ‘Mini Ice Age’ with -50C temperatures in coldest regions, scientists warn","EARTH could face frosty weather and biting snow storms over the next 30 years as an ominous ""solar minimum"" grips the planet, a scientist has warned. The cold snaps – caused by the Sun entering a natural ""hibernation"" – threaten to trigger food shortages as temperatures slump across the planet, experts say. Earth is bracing for a solar minimum: a quiet period in which the Sun fires less energy – or, heat – at our planet than usual. According to Nasa,  the Sun will reach its lowest activity in over 200 years in 2020. This could cause average temperatures to drop as much as 1C in a cold spell lasting 12 months, according to Northumbria University expert Valentina Zharkova. That might not sound like much, but a whole degree is very significant for global average temperatures. ""The Sun is approaching a hibernation period,"" Professor Zharkova, who has published multiple scientific papers on solar minimums, told The Sun. ""Less sunspots will be formed on the solar surface and thus less energy and radiation will be emitted towards the planets and the Earth."" Solar minimums are part of the Sun's natural life cycle and occur once every 11 years. However, 2020's minimum promises to be an especially chilly one. That's because it marks the start of a rare event known as a Grand Solar Minimum, in which energy emitted from the Sun drops even more than usual. These only occur once every 400 years or so. Most of the effects will be harmless. However, Professor Zharkova warned icy spells and wet summers could persist until solar activity picks up again in 2053. She listed recent unusual chills in Canada and Iceland as evidence of the Grand Solar Minimum (GSM) already taking hold. ""The reduction in temperature will results in cold weathers on Earth, wet and cold summers, cold and wet winters,"" she told The Sun. ""We will possibly get big frosts as is happening now in Canada where they see [temperatures] of -50C. ""But this is only the start of GSM, there is more to come in the next 33 years."" The last GSM to strike Earth was the Maunder Minimum, which lasted from 1645 to 1715. During this period, the brightness of the Sun dropped and temperatures plummeted across the globe, according to Nasa. The brutal cold decades saw famous waterways like the Thames and Amsterdam's canals freeze regularly – events that are rare today. Nasa readings of solar activity suggest our planet could find itself in the grips of a similar freeze by 2025. Professor Zharkova added: ""We can only hope that the mini ice age will not be as severe as it was during the Maunder Minimum. ""This would dramatically affect food harvests in middle latitudes, because the vegetables and fruits will not have enough time for harvesting. ""So it could lead to a food deficit for people and animals, as we seen in the past couple of years when the snow in Spain and Greece in April and May demolished they veggie fields, and the UK had a deficit of broccoli, and other fruits and veggies."" Fortunately, it's not all doom and gloom – other experts believe that Grand Solar Minimums have little effect on our climate. Instead, the cold snap experienced during the Maunder Minimum was likely triggered by several factors, including plumes of ash coughed out by a series of giant volcanic eruptions. We're also expecting global warming to increase average temperatures in the coming decades. It's unlikely, therefore, that the upcoming GSM will have any impact on global temperatures, solar scientist Mathew Owens told The Sun. ""The small reduction in the Sun's energy associated with a solar minimum is vastly offset by effects caused by human activity, such as CO2 in the atmosphere,"" Professor Owens, of Reading University, said. ""Thus there will probably be no detectable effect on global climate."""

While massive wind farms are said by some to be the “renewable” energy source of the future, two Harvard scientists have found that the spinning blades of these massive metal monstrosities create more climate warming than coal plants, as one prominent example of the fossil fuel energy that climate alarmists claim is creating global warming. In fact, wind turbines are more “polluting” in terms of the heat they give off than any fossil fuel energy source currently in use, which just goes to show that so-called “clean” energy is, at least in this case, a myth. Published in the journal Joule, the paper concluded that, if all of the electricity demands of the United States could suddenly be supplied by nothing but wind turbines, the surface of the continental states would increase in temperature by a shocking 0.24 degrees Celsius. This figure is vastly greater than the 0.1 degree Celsius temperature reduction that climate fanatics are aiming to achieve by “decarbonizing” our nation’s electricity sector before the finality of this current century. “If your perspective is the next 10 years, wind power actually has – in some respects – more climate impact than coal or gas,” says David Keith, a professor of applied physics and public policy at Harvard, and one of the study’s two primary co-authors. “If your perspective is the next thousand years, then wind power is enormously cleaner than coal or gas,” he added, in a statement.

If we only have less than 12 years left before the world ends due to global warming, then wind power is an absolute no-go At best, the return on “warming” investment from switching to wind power from fossil fuels will only start to become noticeable after about 100 years – and this is only after the planet undergoes a massive warming increase in the years prior. If Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (AOC) warning about the world ending in 12 years due to “global warming” is actually true, then this means that wind power won’t work to save our planet, even if the entirety of the energy production infrastructure was replaced in this instant with wind turbines. “Our analysis suggests that – where feasible – it may make sense to push a bit harder on developing solar power and a bit less hard on wind,” Keith carefully noted in an email about he and his colleague’s findings. But even solar panels create warming, we now know, though at levels substantially lower than wind farms. Even so, they’re a better option than wind farms, which not only harm efforts to “cool” the planet in the short term, but also create illness in many of the people who live near them. As this new study explains, when wind turbines extract energy out of the air, they effectively slow down the wind, which alters “the exchange of heat, moisture, and momentum between the surface and the atmosphere.” While the degree to which this happens is dependent upon ever-changing weather and climate patterns, it is certainly admissible that wind energy is hardly the cure-all for global warming that the climate fanatics continue to claim it is. “So we’re causing more warming with wind power by trying to reduce warming with wind power,” wrote one Twitter user in response to the news. “And we’re smart people?” For more news stories like this, be sure to check out ClimateScienceNews.com."
